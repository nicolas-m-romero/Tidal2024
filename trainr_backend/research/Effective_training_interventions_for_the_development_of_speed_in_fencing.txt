Abstract. Fencing is a sport in which speed, agility, explosive power and anaerobic endurance are essential
for performance; reaction speed and the accuracy of the hit are also indispensable for achieving an optimal
technique. This study aimed to analyse the scientific literature in order to find the most effective training
methods for the development of speed in fencing. Google Scholar, PubMed and Web of Science databases were
accessed with the purpose of finding original research studies focused on developing different forms of speed in
fencing for any technical element of this sport, which were written in English, Romanian or Hungarian and
were accessible in full text. Finally, 16 articles were included in the study. The types of training that led to
improved fencing speed were: eccentric and plyometric training, strength training, core strength training, speed
training, agility training, instability resistance training, fitness training, circuit training, ballistic and dynamic
stretch training (during warm-up), functional training, bilateral transfer training, SAQ (speed, agility,
quickness) training. These types of training were applied to foil, sabre and épée fencers of both genders, from
various age groups and with different levels of training over periods between 1 and 12 months. To date, the
exclusive superiority of one method has not been explicitly proven. In conclusion, it can be argued that several
types of training can develop different forms of fencing speed, especially reaction and execution speed, which
helps to achieve better performance in this sport.
Keywords: fencing, speed, reaction speed, execution speed.

Introduction
Fencing is an opened-skill sport in which the fight takes place between two duelling
athletes who use one of the three weapons: épée, foil or sabre (Chtara et al., 2020). In épée
and foil, a touch is performed by thrusting, while in sabre, this is done with the edge of the
blade (Aquili et al., 2013). In fencing, a thrust or cutting edge is called a touch line. Although
the technical and tactical requirements are very different for these three weapons, it is
however necessary for all fencers using all weapons “to lunge, change direction, and recover
to en garde as soon as possible” (Turner et al., 2017, p. 1666).
Fencing involves a series of explosive attacks followed by low-intensity movements,
predominantly entailing anaerobic metabolism (Wylde et al., 2013).
During competitions, fencers must maintain defensive and offensive movements and
therefore it is very important for their motor skills to be highly developed. Specific
movements, for instance stepping back and forward or jumping, which are used “to make a
touché to the opponent are directly proportional to the athlete’s agility and muscle strength.
In general, these performance parameters may vary depending on the body size and structure
of the fencers, but they can compete with equal success” (Turna, 2020, p. 127)
Sorel et al. (2019) highlight the importance of high levels of coordination, explosive
power, speed and accuracy for fencing effectiveness. These are associated with “perceptual

465

and psychomotor skills (i.e., the ability to quickly and appropriately respond to an opponent’s
actions)” (Turner et al., 2014, p. 3001).
Due to the training process and characteristic movements during an assault, fencing can be
considered a sport in which reaction time plays a significant role in achieving sports
performance (Czajkowski, 2005). Speed is classically defined as the shortest time needed by
an object to move along a fixed distance. In fencing, speed is defined as an athlete’s ability to
perform and complete a movement in the shortest possible time, and reaction speed is one of
its decisive components. Quick reaction, which is closely related to the processing of visual
or tactile stimuli, muscle coordination during the movement, technical and tactical skills or
optimal mental state, greatly influences the overall fencing performance (Balkó et al., 2016).
To be successful in attack, the fencer needs to react as fast as possible to the opponent’s
actions (Milic, Janicijevic et al., 2020). Roi and Bianchedi (2008) suggest that, after
identifying relevant information from the opponent, it is important for the fencer to react
quickly, which requires “good coordination to achieve both speed and accuracy” (p. 474).
The lunge is the most commonly used form of fencing attack and its speed “is considered
critical to success” (Guan et al., 2018, p. 201). In order to lunge, the fencer advances from the
en-garde position, exerts force with the rear foot, accelerating forward with a thrust of the
weapon arm and a step with the front foot (Stewart & Kopetka, 2005). “This acceleration
phase ends when the rear foot stops to push against the floor” (Gutierrez-Davila et al., 2013,
p. 364). Because fencers are constantly under time pressure, they are forced to reduce their
decision-making time and sensorimotor response time (Milic, Nedeljkovic et al., 2020).
Among all the forms of speed encountered in fencing (reaction, execution, repetition,
movement, uniform or non-uniform speed), it can be said that reaction speed and execution
speed are preponderantly the subject of published research. In the literature, there is a wide
range of studies on reaction speed in fencing but none confirms that a certain type of training
programme is the most effective (Torun et al., 2012).
This study aimed to analyse the scientific literature in order to find the most effective
training interventions for the development of speed in fencing athletes.
Methodology
A systematic search of the literature was performed in Google Scholar, PubMed and Web
of Science databases. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
Meta-Analyses) methodology was respected by establishing some inclusion and exclusion
criteria for the identified scientific materials (Page et al., 2021). The search was not limited to
a certain period of time; the initial search revealed articles published between 1968 and 2021.
The following keyword associations were used to search for information: “fencing”, “fencing
speed”, “reaction speed in fencing” or “reaction velocity in fencing”, “fencing speed
development”, “training”; connectors such as “and” or “or” were also used.
This study included articles that focused on the development of fencing speed (for any
technical element), which were written in English, Romanian or Hungarian and were
accessible in full text. After the initial search, duplicates were removed, and the remaining
articles were evaluated in detail. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and single-participant
articles were excluded, as well as those that were not explicitly related to our study.

Results
The preliminary search led to the identification of 79 articles, of which 16 articles with
original studies were considered eligible and included in the final analysis that made concrete
references to the methods approached to increase fencing speed (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Flowchart for the selection of records
The scientific material taken into account highlights that so far the following training
methods have been used to increase fencing speed: eccentric and plyometric training, strength
training, core strength training, speed training, agility training, instability resistance training,
fitness training, circuit training, ballistic and dynamic stretch training (during warm-up),
functional training, bilateral transfer training, SAQ (speed, agility, quickness) training. Some
research was carried out with innovative training and evaluation methods, thus identifying
conditions and factors that favourably influenced speed.
Table 1 presents the main information that supports the effectiveness of certain
interventions made in the training programmes to increase fencing speed.
The main characteristics of the studies included in the review are shown in Table 1.

Discussion
Motor reaction, speed, explosive power and movement accuracy play an important role in
determining fencing success (Singer, 1968; Tuner et al., 2013). Reaction time is essential
“because a faster reaction can reduce the total movement time” (Turna, 2020, p. 128). It is
unanimously accepted that experienced fencers are faster and better than novice fencers in
terms of information processing. Elite fencers show better sequential coordination of the
upper and lower limb movements, with more coherent patterns of muscle activation
compared to beginner fencers (Chen et al., 2017). Guilhem et al. (2014) state that
neuromuscular coordination in elite fencers produces higher magnitudes of forward linear
velocity of the body centre of mass and weapon, which is why training should focus on
explosive power. In addition, constant efforts have been made to find new solutions to
increase speed and agility in all categories of fencing.
Most studies investigating methods of increasing speed in fencing compared the effects of
traditional training with its various changes or by alternating it with other types of training.
Most of the interventions were made over a period of 6-12 weeks and commonly used fencers
who performed traditional training as control groups. None of them explicitly referred to a
particular weapon but to fencing in general.

Following the analysis undertaken, we have observed that there is very little research
comparing the concrete effects of different types of training for the development of speed in
fencing and there are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses studying this information.
Of all the interventions made in the fencing training programmes, some were effective for
increasing speed. Thus:
● Eccentric and plyometric training produced a significant improvement in fencingspecific speed movements; these types of workouts increased the lunge length but the
time needed to perform them remained the same (di Cagnio et al., 2020). This was
obviously also due to increased speed; this training modality, as a variation of training
means, could be recommended for young fencers. According to Turner et al. (2013),
plyometrics and Olympic-style lifts are one of the most effective forms of ballistic
training, which can be adapted to different branches of sport and induce full
acceleration through the entire movement.
● Within 12 weeks, strength training based on maximal and explosive exercises
determined a significant increase in reaction speed, correlated with increased maximal
and explosive power (Redondo et al., 2014); strength training is recommended to be
used because it is a basic component of sports training and can lead to performance.
Guilhem et al. (2014) and Guan et al. (2018) demonstrate that knee biomechanics is
crucial for lunge performance and assert the importance of strength and explosive
power training, especially for knee and hip extensors. A low en-garde position and a
full extension of the rear knee joint during the lunge are suggested to improve the
horizontal peak velocity of the centre of gravity and therefore the fencer’s speed.
● Core strength training induced an increased lunge performance speed (Hamza, 2013).
● The training intervention of yoga practices had statistically significant effects on the
selected physical fitness components: speed, coordination, balance, grip strength,
agility and flexibility. Yoga practices play a vital role in improving the speed,
coordination, balance, grip strength, agility and flexibility of fencing athletes (Patial et
al., 2019).
● Specific and non-specific exercises were used in speed training, and reaction speed was
assessed for both the lower and upper limbs. The results showed that, compared to
traditional training where an increase in reaction speed was obtained only for the upper
limbs, speed training significantly increased reaction speed for all limbs (Torun et al.,
2012).
● Within 6 weeks, agility training led to significant improvements in simple and multiple
reaction time. “In addition to traditional fencing training, agility training can provide
performance advantages to the athletes.” (Turna, 2020, p. 133)
● In the study by Witkowski et al. (2020), bilateral transfer training applied for 6 weeks
led to a significant increase in accuracy and speed for the dexterous hand thrust;
however, the effect was in the short term because, 4 weeks after the programme, there
was no statistically significant difference between the dexterous and non-dexterous
hand. Research on motor coordination shows that both hemispheres of the brain are
involved in controlling the action of each upper limb, so a transfer (interhemispheric)
training programme can effectively improve the accuracy of fencing actions, at least in
the early stages of training (Witkowski et al., 2017).
470

Discobolul – Physical Education, Sport and Kinetotherapy Journal, Volume 60, Issue 4, 465-474

● SAQ training, based on exercises for the development of speed, agility and quickness,
improved strength, coordination, agility and speed in all its forms (Mohamed & Larion,
2018); this type of training can be used individually, therefore there are training
methods for each of its components.
● Instability resistance training, consisting of exercises performed with the Bosu ball,
improved static and dynamic balance but also the performance level of basic fencing
elements, including speed (Elfateh, 2016).
● Circuit training led to a significant increase in lunge speed (Murugesan & Jothi, 2019).
In addition to these findings, a preliminary study conducted on one female fencer who
benefited from a functional training system with modified exercise for fencing (with kettle
bells and rope) produced a better movement quality during single-leg movements and also
improved dynamic leap and balance (Agosti & Autuori, 2020). However, more reliable
results in this area require more research.
The results of the study by Tsolakis et al. (2010) deny the hypothesis that static or ballistic
stretching in the later stages of general warm-up leads to increased specific performance in
fencing. However, they recommend any type of stretching with a maximum duration of 60
seconds for each muscle, followed by a rest period of at least 5 minutes before any other
activity, without fear of affecting the speed and power of fencing athletes.
The use of modern testing methods has led to highlighting the correlations between speed
and specific biomechanical parameters; these aspects justify both the use of such methods in
the training of athletes and the indirect influence of speed by modifying certain
biomechanical aspects of fencing-specific movements. Sorel et al. (2019) used an innovative
simulator for performing lunges in fixed, moving and uncertain conditions; they assessed
lunge accuracy, response time, execution time and maximum sword velocity, demonstrating
that accuracy and success decreased significantly in moving and uncertain conditions
compared to fixed ones and were negatively correlated with the reaction speed of fencers.
The above authors concluded that training with a simulator in uncertain and moving
conditions could induce better accuracy, reaction time and response time, therefore better
speed. Such stimulators can adapt the athlete’s attack to the opponent’s movement and
increase reaction speed and execution speed. Another innovative method to develop the speed
of the kinetic response to the skill of stabbing with a shish weapon was used by Yas et al.
(2020) on beginner fencers and showed that using a device to implement exercises led to
better results than the specific training without such devices.
The limitations of the aforementioned articles are related to: 1. the low number of studies
that have investigated the effects of the same training method on fencing speed, therefore the
impossibility of performing a meta-analysis; 2. the fact that most studies in which the control
group has done traditional fencing training do not describe this type of training, knowing that
it can be quite different; 3. the relatively small number of participants in most of the selected
studies - although specific to this sport, it can affect the reliability of the results.

Conclusion
An essential element that contributes to fencing performance is speed optimisation. To this
end, besides traditional training methods, various interventions have been made over time in
the training programmes of fencing athletes; of these, both those dedicated to increasing
speed and those for developing muscle strength, agility, instability resistance, bilateral
transfer or circuit training have proven to be effective. Adding static or ballistic stretching
elements in the warm-up sequence or using training simulators has also induced an increase
in speed.
Given that speed is determined by a multitude of sensory, psychological, neurological,
articular and muscular factors, it is impossible to find a single element responsible for
increasing speed. We can conclude that complementary interventions towards as many
determinants of speed as possible could bring the desired results.
