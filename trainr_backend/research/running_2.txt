The Training and Development of Elite
Sprint Performance: an Integration of
Scientific and Best Practice Literature
Thomas Haugen1* , Stephen Seiler2, √òyvind Sandbakk3 and Espen T√∏nnessen1

Abstract
Despite a voluminous body of research devoted to sprint training, our understanding of the training process
leading to a world-class sprint performance is limited. The objective of this review is to integrate scientific and best
practice literature regarding the training and development of elite sprint performance. Sprint performance is heavily
dependent upon genetic traits, and the annual within-athlete performance differences are lower than the typical
variation, the smallest worthwhile change, and the influence of external conditions such as wind, monitoring
methodologies, etc. Still, key underlying determinants (e.g., power, technique, and sprint-specific endurance) are
trainable. In this review, we describe how well-known training principles (progression, specificity, variation/
periodization, and individualization) and varying training methods (e.g., sprinting/running, technical training,
strength/power, plyometric training) are used in a sprint training context. Indeed, there is a considerable gap
between science and best practice in how training principles and methods are applied. While the vast majority of
sprint-related studies are performed on young team sport athletes and focus on brief sprints with maximal intensity
and short recoveries, elite sprinters perform sprinting/running over a broad range of distances and with varying
intensity and recovery periods. Within best practice, there is a stronger link between choice of training component
(i.e., modality, duration, intensity, recovery, session rate) and the intended purpose of the training session compared
with the ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù approach in scientific literature. This review provides a point of departure for scientists
and practitioners regarding the training and development of elite sprint performance and can serve as a position
statement for outlining state-of-the-art sprint training recommendations and for generation of new hypotheses to
be tested in future research.

Background
The crowning of the 100-m sprint champion remains a
hallmark of each Olympic Games, and the winners are
‚Äúthe world‚Äôs fastest humans.‚Äù The dramatic world record
progression since the first modern Olympics has been
driven by advancing training methodology and deliberate
practice, combined with key improvements in running
surfaces and footwear. Because sprint running is a core
capacity that underlies performance in many sports,
there is a voluminous body of scientific literature devoted to sprint training. The vast majority of sprint-

related training interventions have reported positive effects on sprinting capabilities [1‚Äì4], leading to the assumption that sprinting performance is easily improved
with a variety of methods. In contrast, observations of
elite athletes over time show a very different reality, one
where most annual within-athlete performance differences are lower than typical variation, the smallest
worthwhile change, and the influence of external conditions (wind, temperature, altitude, timing methods/procedures, etc.) [5, 6]. Plausible explanations for this
mismatch between published science and observed practice are (1) publication bias in favor of positive findings
and (2) subject training status bias, with most experimental data coming from studies of untrained or moderately trained performers.
In contrast to the many descriptive studies of worldclass endurance athletes (e.g., [7‚Äì9]), no studies of
world-class sprinters to date have described the varying
training components (modality, duration, intensity, resting periods, session rate, etc.) across the annual cycle. It
is fair to say that positive developments in sprint training
methods employed by world-class athletes have not been
driven by sports scientists. Publicly available ‚Äúrecipe
books‚Äù and training guides based upon the practical experience and intuition of world-leading sprint coaches,
and also governing body documents from acknowledged
athletics federations, have become important and popular sources of best practice training information and
framework development for the international sprint
community [10‚Äì18]. We believe combining data sources
from available research evidence and results-proven
practice provides a valid point of departure for outlining
state-of-the-art sprint training recommendations and for
generation of new hypotheses to be tested in future research. The objective of this review is therefore to integrate scientific and best practice literature regarding the
training and development of elite sprint performance.
Although the present review is anchored in athletics and
competitive 100-m sprinting, most of the content is also
relevant for other sports where linear sprints frequently
occur.

Sprint Performance Determinants
The 100-m sprint has traditionally been categorized into
three main phases: acceleration, maximal velocity, and
deceleration [19, 20]. The acceleration phase can in turn
be segregated into initial (start block and reaction), middle, and final subsections [21]. Reaction time in worldclass sprinters is typically 0.17‚Äì0.18 ¬± 0.03 s [22]. The
shape of the velocity curve is consistent across performance level, but the duration and quality of each phase
vary from athlete to athlete. Overall, maximal velocity is
highly correlated with 100-m sprint performance, and
the best sprinters accelerate over a longer distance than

Page 2 of 16

their lower performing counterparts [23, 24]. Table 1
displays an overview of observed split times as a function
of 100-m sprint performance level [25‚Äì32] and can be
used to identify individual strengths and weaknesses
across the varying phases.
Power, technique, and sprint-specific endurance are
considered key underlying determinants of 100-m sprint
performance [3, 11‚Äì16, 24, 33, 34]. A very strong relationship exists between maximal horizontal power output and sprint performance; the shorter the sprint
distance is, the higher the association with maximal
horizontal power output [35]. Power output demand in
sprinting increases exponentially with velocity [35, 36].
Slawinski et al. [23] reported that step averaged maximal
horizontal power output in male and female world-class
sprinters was 30.3 ¬± 2.5 and 24.5 ¬± 4.2 W kg‚àí 1, respectively, typically reached after ~ 1 s of sprinting. The highest individual values for men and women were 36.1 and
29.3 W kg‚àí 1 respectively, representing current upper
limits in humans [37].
Although the basic principles of sprinting are relatively
simple and governed by the laws of motion, the way an
athlete solves the mechanical constraints and utilizes the
degrees of freedom within these constraints is far more
complex [24]. A review of research literature shows that
the following kinematic variables have received the most
attention [38‚Äì47]:
 Spatiotemporal variables (e.g., step length, step rate,

contact time, flight/aerial time)
 Segment configuration at touchdown and lift-off
 Lower-limb segment velocities immediately prior to

touchdown or during ground contact
 Front- and back-side mechanics

Indeed, sprint mechanical variables are entangled, and
no single variable is associated with better performance
[24]. Because kinetics and kinematics are entwined, athletes cannot apply sprinting mechanics that they are not
adequately predisposed to. For more information regarding the sprint running technique, we refer to previously
published biomechanical analyses (e.g., [20, 24, 33, 34,
38‚Äì51]).
Sprint-specific endurance refers to the deceleration
phase of the sprint. The velocity decline is typically accompanied by a reduction in step rate [24]. Sprintrelated fatigue is attributed to disturbances in the central
nervous system and peripheral factors within the skeletal
muscles [52‚Äì55]. Available research indicates that leg
stiffness, which influences elastic energy storage, is particularly crucial for sprint-specific endurance [56‚Äì61].
Sprint-specific endurance is also determined by instantaneous energy delivery [24]. Estimated from accumulated oxygen deficit measures, the relative anaerobic

Usain Bolt‚Äôs world record race from 2009

energy system contribution (from stored adenosine triphosphate, stored phosphocreatine, and anaerobic glycolysis) is about 80% for 100-m sprint [62].
Sprint performance is heavily dependent upon genetic
traits. Charlie Francis, an acknowledged sprint coach,
stated that ‚Äúsprinters are born, not made‚Äù [14]. However,
which genetic profiles make the greatest contribution
has been the subject for much debate [63, 64], as genetic
predispositions include not only anthropometric characteristics and muscle fiber-type proportions, but also the
capacity to adapt to training [65, 66]. In general, elite
performance appears polygenetic, with the contribution
of numerous genetic variants being additive.

Sprint Performance Development
Sprint performance capacity evolves and devolves
throughout life via growth, maturation, training, and
aging [5, 67‚Äì69]. Age of peak performance in worldclass sprinters is typically 25‚Äì26 years [5, 70, 71]. However, the concept of training age needs to be considered
when assessing age of peak performance. Athletes who
start with specialized training at a young age may also
tend to reach their peak performance at an earlier age
than their counterparts who specialize somewhat later.
Haugen et al. [5] reported that for world top 100
sprinters in their early 20s, mean annual improvements
were in the range of only 0.1‚Äì0.2%. The very best athletes generally display greater improvement in the years
just preceding age of peak performance compared with
their lower performing counterparts [5, 72, 73]. For example, Haugen et al. [72] reported that the world‚Äôs alltime best male and female sprinters improved by an
average of 8% from 18 years of age, while the

corresponding improvement for Norwegian nationallevel competitive sprinters was 1.3‚Äì1.4%. The potential
use of doping among some of the investigated athletes
may have affected these results, but trainability variations across performance level may also be explained by
other factors (e.g., training status, responsiveness to
training, coaching quality, nutrition, etc.). Nevertheless,
it becomes very challenging to enhance or even maintain
sprint performance beyond the age of 30 [5, 70], most
likely due to neural and/or hormonal factors and an agerelated decrease in type II fiber distribution and/or
cross-sectional area [74‚Äì76].
Identification and development of sprint talent are
confounded by the observed variation in physical maturation rate and timing. Elite junior athletics is characterized by a combination of marked relative-age effects and
high attrition rates. Many young athletes may be discouraged from continuing to senior level before realizing
their full potential [77, 78]. Boccia et al. [79] observed
that, within a group of talented young performers, athletic performance in the early teens is not a good predictor of senior performance in long and high jump. It is
reasonable to assume that this is also true for sprinting.
Taken all findings together, sprinters who perform at a
high junior level without excessive specialization are at
the optimal point of departure for senior success. Excessive specialization and inappropriate training progression
increase the odds of nonfunctional overreaching, overtraining, and performance stagnation [80, 81]. A widely
held view is that elite performance requires ~ 10 years or
10,000 h of deliberate practice to acquire the necessary
skills and experience to perform at an international level
[82, 83]. Although the deliberate practice framework has

Haugen et al. Sports Medicine - Open

(2019) 5:44

gained popularity in sport science and in popular literature, its applicability to sprint running is very limited.
The publicly available biography of Usain Bolt [84] exemplifies that extremely talented athletes can reach an
international level within only 5‚Äì6 years of deliberate
practice. Indeed, there is considerable variation among
athletes and numerous routes to expertise under optimal
conditions. As a foundation for long-term training strategy, coaches rely on well-established training principles
to design programs and make educated decisions.

sessions with spike shoes on a rubberized track surface.
Because such training is demanding for the central nervous system, empirical evidence suggests that intensive
sprinting sessions require at least 48 h of recovery.
Hence, sprinting on consecutive days rarely occurs
among leading practitioners [10‚Äì18]. In contrast, recovery sessions or low-intensive intervals are typically
performed with cushioned running shoes/trainers on
grass or artificial turf. There is a long tradition for
low-intensive interval training on grass in Jamaican
sprinting [10].

Training Principles
Progressive Overload

Specificity

Long-term performance development is only achieved
when athletes are exposed to a systematic increase in
training load over time, while adequate recovery is ensured [85]. Indeed, the capacity to perform and absorb
large training loads is seen as both an adaptation over
time and a talent in itself. Training load in sprint running is determined by a series of components such as
training modality (e.g., sprinting/running, strength training, plyometric training), duration, intensity, resting periods, session rate, running surface, and footwear [10‚Äì
16]. These components will be treated more in detail in
a sprint-specific setting later in this review.
The principle of progressive overload is envisioned to
reduce the risk of injury and overtraining while stimulating long-term training adaptations. Excessive and rapid
increases in training loads are likely responsible for a
large proportion of soft-tissue injuries [86, 87]. In
sprinters, the training phase immediately following the
off-season and the transition phase between the preparation period and competitive season are particularly vulnerable periods for injury. Haugen et al. [88] observed
that two-thirds of all hamstring injuries in competitive
sprinters occurred in the transition period between specific preparation and competition season. This period is
ideally characterized by large reductions in training volume, increases in training intensity/sprint speed, and
positive ‚Äúbumps‚Äù in individual sprint performance development. Therefore, during the initial weeks of a sprint
training program, there should be a gradual
familiarization, both in terms of intensity and duration/
repetitions. Moreover, it is crucial that sprinters gradually mobilize their maximal sprinting capacity as the
competitive season approaches. When the difference between training speed and competition speed is too large,
injury risk appears to increase, but aggregated data on
this relationship in competitive sprinters are lacking.
Running surface and footwear are crucial and specific
modifiers of training load for sprinting. It is generally assumed that the harder the surface is, the higher the
neuromuscular load for the lower limbs [10, 11, 13‚Äì15].
Most elite sprinters perform high-intensive sprinting

Training adaptations are specific to the stimulus applied,
encompassing movement patterns and force-velocity
characteristics such as muscle actions and muscle
groups used, speed of movement, range of motion, training load, and energy systems involved [89]. Based on
these considerations, it is not surprising that sprint running and high-velocity movements are paramount for
sprint performance enhancement [4, 90]. According to
Charlie Francis, the main stimulus is the number of
sprinting meters at high intensity [13, 14]. However,
there are also variations within specific conditions. For
example, sprint running can be performed under
assisted or resisted conditions. Other ‚Äúless specific‚Äù
training forms such as strength, power, and plyometric
training are commonly performed to target the underlying components of sprint performance [10‚Äì18]. Although these training forms do not duplicate the holistic
sprint running movement, they provide targeted stimuli
of important components that limit sprint performance.
The varying training methods for sprint performance enhancements are treated more in detail later in this
review.
Variation and Periodization

The principle of variation builds on the notion that systematic variation in specific training variables is most effective for long-term adaptations [90‚Äì92]. According to
the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), advanced athletes should perform training with higher
relative loading in a periodized fashion. The higher the
performance level, the more systematic variation is recommended [90]. The most commonly investigated training theory involving planned training variation is
periodization, an often misused term that today refers to
any form of training plan, regardless of structure [92].
Matveyev was the first to write a book about training
periodization in the 1960s [93]. A key feature for the
traditional periodization model was early emphasis on
high training volume with low intensity, followed by a
gradual transition to higher training intensity and reduced volume as the competition periods approached.

Haugen et al. Sports Medicine - Open

(2019) 5:44

Several leading sprint coaches are skeptical of the classic
periodization model because (1) the initial high-volume/
low-intensity training leads to inappropriate adaptations,
(2) the high-intensity training closer to the competition
season encompasses insufficient volume, and (3) the
steep intensification of training at the end of the preparation period leads to an unnecessary increase in injury
risk [11, 13, 14]. It should be noted, however, that many
sprint coaches apply a form of traditional periodization,
although with fewer fluctuations in intensity and volume
than Matveyev‚Äôs original model.
Block training periodization was introduced by Verkhoshansky [94] in the 1980s and has been widely used
by prominent coaches. The term ‚Äúblock training‚Äù has
generally been understood to consist of training cycles
of highly concentrated specialized workloads. The usefulness of block training has also been questioned by acknowledged sprint coaches, as the model prohibits
developed skills to be maintained throughout the varying
meso-cycles [11]. Publicly available information indicates
that alternative periodization models are used within
elite sprinting communities [10‚Äì16]. Choice of
periodization model seems to depend on sprint distance
(100 m vs. 400 m), daily situation (high school/college/
university level, professionals vs. semi-professionals or
amateurs), and tradition. Some coaches classify the
training year into one preparation phase and one competition period. Double periodization (i.e., two peaking
phases) is more common, consisting of a preparation
phase, an indoor season, a new preparation phase, and
finally an outdoor competition season. Some of the very
best athletes also split the outdoor season into early and
late peaks in order to prepare for national trials and
international championships. Classification of training
into ‚Äúheavy‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù weeks within the preparation periods is another important aspect within periodization.
Leading practitioners typically use a 2:1 or 3:1
periodization, that is, 2 or 3 weeks with relatively high
training load are followed by an easier training week for
recovery purposes [10, 11, 13, 14].
The ‚Äúlong-to-short‚Äù periodization model is typically
applied by long-sprint specialists [11]. This approach focuses on long distances in the early preparation period
and progresses to short distances throughout the training year [11, 15, 16]. An even more popular
periodization model for sprinters was introduced by
Charlie Francis in the 1980s, termed ‚Äúshort to long‚Äù [13,
14]. Here, training periods are mainly differentiated by
the relative emphasis on each phase of a sprint: acceleration, maximum velocity, and deceleration. The initial
meso-cycles focus on short sprints and power training,
culminating with the indoor season where 60 m is the
main event. Maximal velocity is prioritized after the indoor season, while sprint-specific endurance becomes

Page 5 of 16

more prioritized when approaching the outdoor season.
According to the model, it is easier to improve maximal
velocity and then extend the duration that velocity can
be maintained. The short-to-long periodization model
ensures that developed skills are not lost. Maintaining
key elements while adjusting the demand of a given skill
is a vital principle. This short-to-long approach has been
used by numerous leading practitioners in the last decades [10, 11, 13‚Äì16].
Another key feature within the short-to-long
periodization model is the polarized training concept.
More specifically, sprinting intensity should be either ‚â•
95% or < 70% of maximal velocity to enhance performance or facilitate recovery, respectively [11, 13, 14]. It is
assumed that mid-range intensities (~ 70‚Äì95%) are not
beneficial either for performance or recovery and should
be avoided. Dan Pfaff, the coach of Donovan Bailey
(former 100-m world record holder and Olympic Champion), has for many years practiced a concurrent, polarized, and short-to-long model of thinking within the
micro-cycle build approaching a competition season [11,
17]. Three-day training blocks are utilized: short accelerations are performed on Monday, maximal velocity
sprinting on Wednesday, and sprint-specific endurance
on Friday. We note that the polarized training
organization performed in certain sprinting communities
bears great resemblance with training intensity distribution in elite endurance athletes, which is typically organized after a polarized pattern (e.g., [7, 95, 96]). In sprint
running, the polarized approach might resemble required training quality when training at the highest velocities, and at the same time sufficient volume of
sprinting. Training in between these ‚Äúzones/velocities‚Äù
might be ‚Äúa black hole‚Äù, where neither the quality nor
the quantity for further development is achieved. Overall, the physiological mechanisms underlying the polarized training concept are far from understood, and
future studies should pay more attention to this topic.
In conclusion, elite coaches plan the training of their
athletes with significant detail. However, the underlying
mechanisms for the superiority of specific periodization
models in sprint running remain unclear, and there is no
direct evidence enabling us to compare outcomes across
the various periodization methodologies [92].
Individualization

Individualization is a general training principle and refers to the idea that training must be prescribed according to individual performance capacity and
predispositions such as anthropometric factors, training
status/age, sex, recovery/injury status, and force-velocity
profiles [10, 13, 14, 90, 97]. For example, the kinematics
of sprinting varies according to performance level and
anthropometric factors. This includes spatiotemporal

Haugen et al. Sports Medicine - Open

(2019) 5:44

variables, start block positioning, trunk angle during the
early acceleration phase, and lower limb joint angles [20,
38, 40, 51]. Hence, coaches cannot implement sprinting
mechanics that their athletes are not predisposed to by
nature and prepared for through training. For example,
a mediocre athlete will likely sprint slower when trying
to adapt the step length of a world-class sprinter as the
ground reaction forces typically become more vertically
oriented.
Total training volume generally increases with training
age, but as athletes approach their maximum potential
at the end of their career, training volume may decrease
to accommodate increased need for recovery time between high-intensity sessions [15, 16]. This coincides
well with age-related changes in anabolic hormone concentration that play a crucial role in the body‚Äôs metabolic, tissue repair, and anabolic capabilities in response
to training. For example, testosterone is positive for
sprint performance [98]. From the third decade, circulating testosterone levels decline gradually each year [74,
99]. There are also sex differences in endocrine response
to training, as several strength training studies have revealed significant elevations in the recovery of testosterone and free testosterone in men through 30 min into
recovery, while no or limited acute elevations have been
observed in women [100]. Within this context, it is interesting to note that Stephen Francis, an acknowledged Jamaican sprint coach, has argued that women should
perform training sessions with 20% less volume than men
[10]. A counter argument would be that women are able
to absorb higher training volumes, because their maximal
velocity is ~ 10% lower than men (corresponding to substantially lower peak force and power loads on the neuromuscular apparatus). The scientific training literature
provides very limited information regarding potential sex
differentiation of training prescription, and future studies
should devote more attention to this topic.
Training history appears to modulate recovery processes, but this interplay is not well appreciated in the
research literature. In the American College of Sports
Medicine position stand, the recommendations for rest
period length and training frequency for power training
are like those for novice, intermediate, and advanced
athletes [90]. In contrast, the guidelines outlined by the
UK Athletics state that duration, number of repetitions,
and recovery time in sprint-specific training sessions
should be adjusted according to training status and performance level [15, 16]. For example, an underlying assumption in high-performance environments is that
each sprint performed by an elite athlete is more demanding on the entire neuromuscular system than for
their lower performing counterparts, and hence, more
recovery time between each sprint is needed [15, 16].
Future research should aim to verify this claim.

Page 6 of 16

It has recently been suggested that individualized
sprint training should be based on force-velocity (Fv)
profiles [97, 101, 102]. A possible avenue for such an approach is individual test comparison with group mean
values, where athletes with velocity deficits should be
prescribed more maximal velocity sprinting, while athletes with horizontal force deficits should prioritize more
horizontal strength work [97]. Although reference values
have been outlined for athletes across sprint performance levels [23, 35, 38], it remains unclear if such an approach is effective [103]. The logic of this approach
builds on an assumed direct relationship between acceleration and peak velocity measurements for the runner
and the underlying contractile characteristics of the
muscle groups involved. However, the fascicle shortening velocities of active muscles do not necessarily change
with increasing running velocity [104‚Äì106]. The relationship between changes in running velocity and
muscle fascicle shortening velocity appears to be complicated by an increased contribution from elastic properties with increasing running velocity [104‚Äì106]. Running
velocity is not a proxy for muscle contraction velocity,
and for this reason, Helland et al. [107] have questioned
the use of Fv profiling in this context. More research is
required regarding how training should be evaluated and
modified based on force-velocity assessments.

Training Methods
Sprint Training

The vast majority of scientific studies investigating sprint
training methods are performed on young team sport
athletes where brief sprints with short recoveries are the
norm [1‚Äì4]. Therefore, sprint training recommendations
from the research literature have limited relevance to
competitive sprinting, where elite 100-m athletes perform sprint-specific training over various distances.
Practitioners classify sprint running either according to
phase of interest or primary energy system used [11‚Äì16].
For the latter, sprint duration shorter than 6‚Äì7 s is considered alactic, while longer sprints are considered lactic
[11‚Äì16]. In the following paragraphs, we present best
practice guidelines for specific sprint training according
to phase of interest. Total volume within these sessions
is typically guided by the intensity and visual inspection
of technique. That is, the session should be ended when
drop-off in performance and/or technical deterioration
is observed [11, 13‚Äì16]. Table 2 summarizes the best
practice guidelines, while Table 3 shows examples of
training weeks across varying meso-cycles.
Acceleration

When acceleration is the primary focus, leading practitioners recommend 10‚Äì50-m sprints from blocks,
crouched or a three-point start position [10, 11, 13‚Äì18].

Maximal velocity

Intensity is expressed in percent of maximal velocity. Recovery = time between repetitions (sets). HIS = high-intensive session
a
Flying start distance excluded
b
The perceived effort is maximal, so the velocity decline is caused by resistance loading

Block starts are considered more energetically costly
than standing starts. The distances used will vary depending on athlete performance level, as better sprinters
reach higher top speeds and accelerate longer than their
lower performing counterparts. Full recovery is required
between each sprint, allowing the athlete to perform
each repetition without a drop-off in performance. According to the UK Athletics, longer recoveries are required for elite sprinters who are reaching higher absolute
intensities than for younger developmental athletes [15].
A typical acceleration session for a young and relatively
untrained athlete might be runs over 20 m from a
crouched start with 2-min recovery between each repetition, while an elite sprinter may perform sprints over
40 m from blocks with 7-min recovery in between [15].
Maximal Velocity

Flying sprints are typically recommended when the focus
is to develop maximal velocity [11, 13‚Äì16]. The aim is to
reach the highest velocity possible and continue the
sprint run for only as long as velocity does not decrease.
Athletes are able to maintain maximal velocity for only
around 10‚Äì30 m, depending on performance level and
training status [31, 32]. Flying sprints are often performed from a rolling (jog in) start. Although the rate of
acceleration is reduced, the athlete may be able to
achieve a higher maximum velocity or reach the same
velocity as after maximal acceleration but using less

energy. The run-up distance typically ranges from 20 to
60 m, depending on the distance an athlete needs to
reach the highest speeds. Young and relatively untrained
athletes may use a 20-m build-up for 10-m flying sprints
with ~ 4-min recovery in between. In contrast, elite
competitors may use a 40-m build-up for 30-m flying
sprints. Because their speeds may approach 12 m s‚àí 1,
the recovery interval may need to be ~ 15 min before
they can reproduce the performance again [11, 13‚Äì16].
Sprint-Specific Endurance

The aim of sprint-specific endurance training is to improve the ability to maintain sprint velocity for as long as
possible. Such training is typified by runs lasting 7‚Äì15 s at
95‚Äì100% intensity, with full recovery used between repetitions and sets [11, 13‚Äì18]. A rule of thumb among practitioners is that 1‚Äì2-min recovery is required for every
second spent on maximal sprinting [15, 16]. The higher
the performance standard, the longer the recovery periods
are required. While 2‚Äì3 √ó 100-m sprints with 10-min recovery may be an adequate sprint-specific endurance session for a relatively untrained junior, a well-trained elite
competitor may perform 4‚Äì6 √ó 150-m sprints with 20‚Äì30min recovery between repetitions [15, 16].
Speed Endurance

While most scientific studies recommend that sprinting
repetitions should be performed with maximal velocity

[1‚Äì4], acknowledged practitioners have over decades
prescribed sprint training during the preparation phase
with sub-maximal intensity. Pioneer sprint coach Carlo
Vittori (founder of the European School in sprint training and coach of the former 200-m world record holder
Pietro Mennea) introduced the ‚Äúspeed endurance‚Äù concept already in the mid-1970s [12]. This consisted of
series with repeated sprints over 60‚Äì80 m, interspersed
with approximately 2- and 8-min recovery between
sprints and series. The intensity began at 90% of maximal sprint velocity in the initial weeks and progressed
to 95% throughout the preparation period. This was accompanied by a gradual increase in total volume from 6
to 800 m (e.g., 2 series of 5 √ó 60 m) and up to 1500‚Äì
2000 m (e.g., 5 series of 5 √ó 60 m) during the preparation
phase. However, as the competition season approached,
the total volume decreased while the intensity gradually
increased to maximal effort [12]. Vittori‚Äôs speed endurance concept has later been adopted by other acknowledged sprint coaches [11, 13‚Äì16].
Available evidence in endurance and strength training
also demonstrates that high but sub-maximal intensity
loading effectively stimulates adaptation through the
interaction between high intensity and larger accumulated work that can be achieved before the onset of fatigue, compared with maximal efforts [90, 108]. While
most practitioners argue that 92‚Äì95% intensity is required [11, 13‚Äì16], the lowest effective sprinting intensity for stimulating adaptation is so far not established in
the research literature. Given the exponential relationship between power and velocity, a reduction from maximal to ~ 95% of maximal velocity represents a
substantial reduction in force and power load on the
neuromuscular system. Most coaches tend to link speed
endurance training to the deceleration phase of the
sprint. Scientific studies of team sport athletes indicate that sub-maximal sprinting (i.e., ~ 90‚Äì95% of
maximal velocity) is more effective for enhancing
maximal velocity than for improving the acceleration
phase [109‚Äì111].
Practitioners typically assess the athletes‚Äô velocity during sprint training sessions for control and intensity
regulation, and timing gates with 10‚Äì30-m intervals are
typically used for this purpose. The intensity scale in
Table 4, which is based on the velocity obtained during
10-, 20-, and 30-m splits (excluding the acceleration
phase), can assist practitioners during sprint-specific
training sessions.
Resisted Sprinting

Resisted sprinting is a commonly used method to overload specific capacities for sprinting acceleration performance, including uphill sprinting, sled sprints, or
using motorized devices. Although sled sprints have

All calculations are based on the mean velocity obtained during the
flying sprints

been most investigated in the research literature [2], uphill sprinting has also been reported as an effective tool
for sprint performance improvement, at least in team
sport players [112, 113]. It has been suggested that
resisted sprint training may be a more effective tool to
improve horizontal force and power production during
sprinting compared with, e.g., traditional strength and
power training performed in the gym [2, 114]. It is hypothesized that better transfer to sprint performance can
be achieved if the resistance training exercises mimic the
motor pattern and contraction type of performance
movement. Resisted sprints are typically categorized
based on the performance time decrement induced by
the resistance into light (< 10% velocity decrement),
moderate (10‚Äì15%), heavy (15‚Äì30%), and very heavy (>
30%) loads [2]. A limited number of studies have
exceeded relatively light resistance loading in fear of
constraints such as slower running velocity and/or altered running technique [2, 115]. However, acknowledged scientists have recently questioned this approach,

Haugen et al. Sports Medicine - Open

(2019) 5:44

as strength and power exercises with heavy weights
might be replaced by moderate to very heavy resisted
sprint loading [114, 116, 117]. According to Cross et al.
[114], the optimal loading for maximizing power output
during resisted sprinting is a resistance that reduces the
maximal velocity by ~ 50%. Morin et al. [117] tested the
use of very heavy resistance load in soccer players and
observed a substantial, increased horizontal force production when compared with non-resisted sprinting.
However, only trivial between-group differences were
observed for power output and sprint performance. Because peak power output during a maximal sprint is
reached after very few steps and falls substantially during
the remaining part of the sprint [23, 38], it is reasonable
to assume that the entire power output range should be
targeted during the training process. What is beneficial
for a small portion of the sprint is not necessarily beneficial for overall performance. Haugen et al. [35] proposed
that heavy resisted sprinting is likely more appropriate
for sports where the athletes are required to perform
brief sprints while moving an external mass (e.g., bobsleigh). Overall, the literature is equivocal regarding the
potential short-term effects of resisted sprinting when
compared with sprinting under normal conditions [2, 3].
Still, specific adaptations are observed for resisted sprint
training. That is, resisted sprint training improves
resisted sprint performance more than sprint performance under normal conditions [118]. Whether enhanced
resisted sprint performance provides potential transfer
effects to normal sprinting over time remains unknown.
Resisted sprinting is commonly used in the preparatory training phase among successful sprint groups [10‚Äì
16]. However, the resistance loading varies across groups
and individuals. While the UK Athletics argues that only
light loads should be used to ensure proper running mechanics [15, 16], some of the very best Jamaican
sprinters (e.g., Asafa Powell) have applied heavy resistance loads during sled sprints [10]. However, resisted
sprinting is not prioritized during the competition season in either of these elite sprinting groups.
Assisted Sprinting

Assisted sprinting (e.g., downhill running, being pulled
by an elastic cord or motorized devices) has occasionally
been used by scientists and practitioners as a tool for
maximal velocity improvement. Athletes are typically advised to focus on high step rate when approaching their
maximal velocity during assisted sprints [103, 119, 120].
That is, supramaximal velocity should be a result of
higher step rate, shorter ground contact times, and
higher hip angle velocities. Clark et al. [121] observed
that towing force magnitude influences the kinematics
of supramaximal running. Potentially negative training
effects may arise (e.g., increased foot touchdown

Page 9 of 16

distance relative to center of mass), and towing force
should be individualized to avoid poorer sprint mechanics. Due to the lack of studies investigating assisted
sprinting and differences in methodology, it is difficult
to draw conclusions from the research literature. Practitioners are generally reluctant to use assisted sprinting
devices due to injury risk [10, 11, 13‚Äì16], although tail
wind sprinting is typically preferred on windy days.
Some athletes include assisted sprinting as a part of the
warm-up routines prior to competitions. To the best of
our knowledge, no studies or practitioners to date have
applied assisted sprints for energy preservation purposes.
Athletes may be able to perform higher volumes of submaximal sprinting (e.g., ~ 95% intensity) during assisted
conditions as each sprint is performed with less perceived effort compared to sprinting under normal conditions. This approach remains to be tested.

Technical Training

Although research literature has emphasized the importance of technique on sprint running performance [20,
24, 33, 38, 40, 49, 51], very few sprint-related studies are
devoted to how optimal mechanics can be achieved. The
concept of competency-based progression is particularly
emphasized in motor learning literature. That is, athletes
should not progress to more challenging aspects of
training until they master the underpinning principles
[122]. Childhood is clearly the most opportune time for
fundamental movement skill mastery [123, 124], and acknowledged practitioners have experienced that running
movements become more challenging to modify when
approaching senior age [10, 11, 15, 16]. Improving a
sprinter‚Äôs mechanics can be considered a career-long
pursuit.
Although sprint training ‚Äúalways‚Äù involves technical
aspects, sprint drills are commonly used by practitioners
to reinforce the technical work, for proprioception, and
to isolate specific movement features [10‚Äì18]. These include hurdle drills, walking high knees, running high
knees, skips, and straight leg bounding, with focus on
posture, high hips, front-foot landing, configuration at
touchdown and lift-off, etc. Drills are low-speed exercises that are easier to control than high-speed running,
typically performed as a part of warm-up routine. Motor
learning research tells us that for positive reinforcement
of the technique to occur, the biomechanics used in
practice must closely resemble those used in competition [89, 122]. Hence, sprint drills must target key technical elements, ensuring crossover effects to normal
sprinting over time. Such exercises must be prescribed
individually to target the athlete‚Äôs limiting factor and
provide each athlete a feeling of proper sprinting mechanics [11, 15, 16].

Haugen et al. Sports Medicine - Open

(2019) 5:44

Well-developed coaching skills are a necessity for the
practitioner to effectively interact with athletes of all
levels [80]. Indeed, coaching communication, feedback,
and specific verbal instructions play an integral role in
the skill development of sprinting [10, 11, 13, 14]. Although external focus (i.e., on the desired movement effect) has been highlighted in the research literature for
enhancing motor performance and skill learning [125‚Äì
127], most novice coaches use verbal cues during practice that promote an internal focus of attention (i.e., on
body movements) [128]. The very best coaches provide
allegorical/metaphorical feedback where attention is
called upon the athlete‚Äôs feeling while executing the
practices [129]. For example, the cue ‚Äútrim the grass
with your toes‚Äù can be used when the aim is to reduce
the flight time during the very first steps of the acceleration phase [128]. Here, art and science do seem to
merge, given the interrelation between word choices
during instruction, interpreted motor pattern change by
athlete, and resulting force and power production. According to Glen Mills, the coach of Usain Bolt, focused
athletes with well-developed proprioceptive senses are
paramount for coaching to be successful [10].
Strength and Power Training

Strength and power training has received considerable research attention over the years, and training recommendations for hypertrophy, maximal strength, and power are
outlined for novice, intermediate, and advanced athletes
[90, 129]. Ballistic exercises with loading up to ~ 60% of
one repetition maximum appear to be a highly potent
loading stimulus for improving maximal power [90, 130,
131]. However, heavier loading might be necessary to increase the force component of the power equation. Although there is a fundamental relationship between
strength and power [130, 132, 133], improvements in
sprinting performance do not necessarily occur immediately after a period of strength training [134]. In fact,
heavy strength training may induce negative short-term
effects on sprint performance [135]. As an athlete gets
heavier, the energy cost of accelerating that mass also increases, as does the aerodynamic drag associated with
pushing a wider frontal area through the air. ‚ÄúBigger‚Äù is
not necessarily better for sprinting, likely explaining why
male and female elite sprinters have a body mass of ‚Äúonly‚Äù
77 ¬± 7 and 58 ¬± 5 kg, respectively [136]. Haugen et al. [35]
observed that volleyball/beach volleyball players were
among the best sports in terms of horizontal force production during accelerated running, while weight-/powerlifters produced clearly lower values despite no substantial
group mean differences in body mass. Vertically oriented
and heavy strength training of the lower limbs does not
automatically translate to higher horizontal force production during accelerated sprinting [137], but the probability

Page 10 of 16

of positive effects increases when strength and sprint
training are combined [90, 138, 139].
Strength and power training is crucial parts of the
overall training strategy among leading sprint practitioners, and such training is typically performed 2‚Äì3
times per week during the preparation period [10, 11,
13, 14, 18]. Exercise selection typically varies from general (e.g., squat, snatch, clean and jerk) to more ‚Äúsprint
specific‚Äù (e.g., split squats, single-leg deadlifts, lunges,
step-ups, and one-legged squats). Sequencing of sessions
differs among coaches, but the majority schedule
strength training the day after sprint-specific training to
avoid sore muscles when sprinting. Strength and power
training is typically structured as consecutive 4‚Äì6-week
cycles where emphasis is first put on hypertrophy, then
maximal strength, and finally explosive strength/power/
plyometric training [11, 13, 14, 138]. The goal of this
model is to ‚Äútransform‚Äù maximum strength in weight
room exercises into functional power on the track.
These periods of heavy strength training are often combined with high volumes of sprint training at submaximal intensity. The closer to the competition season
is, the more emphasis on maximal velocity sprinting, explosive strength, and ballistic exercises [11, 13, 14, 18].
Overall, no major discrepancies in sprint-related
strength and power training recommendations can be
observed between science and best practice when comparing these literature sources.
Plyometric Training

Plyometric exercises are characterized by rapid stretchshortening cycle muscle actions and include a range of
unilateral and bilateral bounding, hopping, jumping, and
medicine ball throw variations [140]. Plyometric training
is normally performed with little or no external resistance and has been shown to significantly improve maximal power output during sport-specific movements
[130, 141]. As a rule, the more specific a plyometric exercise is to stretch rate and load characteristics of the
sport movement, the greater the transfer of the training
effect to performance. Sprinters are encouraged to use
different types of high-intensive bounding, jumping, and
skipping exercises to ensure that power production is
exerted in the horizontal plane [130, 141]. The underlying mechanisms are theorized to elicit specific adaptations in neural drive, rate of neural activation, and
intermuscular control, which result in an improved rate
of force development [130].
The reutilization of stored energy as a strategy for
sprint performance has recently been questioned by
Haugen et al. [24], as storage and release of elastic energy take time. Human tendons stretch under load, and
sprinters should likely minimize the downside of having
these elastic connectors. Adding to the argument, world-

Haugen et al. Sports Medicine - Open

(2019) 5:44

class performers sprint with considerably higher leg stiffness than their lower performing counterparts [24].
Based on these considerations, sprinters should focus on
leg stiffness (e.g., short ground contact time) during
plyometric exercises. Interestingly, this approach was
utilized with seeming success by coach Carlo Vittori and
the Italian School of sprint training already in the 1970s.
The best athlete, Pietro Mennea, performed horizontal
jumps and skipping exercises with a weight belt, and
ground contact time during these exercises never
exceeded 100 ms [12]. This contact time is very similar
to those obtained by elite sprinters at maximal velocity
[24]. Mennea also performed assisted sprints while
equipped with a weight belt (weight vests serve the same
purpose). Although these training methods offer strong
leg stiffness stimulations, they are demanding and probably increase injury risk, particularly for the Achilles tendon. This may explain why most practitioners perform
more traditional plyometric drills as bilateral obstacle
(hurdle) jumps, multi jump circuits, medicine ball
throws, and unilateral bounding exercises [10‚Äì18]. Although the highest volumes are accomplished during the
preparation phase, some plyometric training is performed during the competition season [10, 11, 15, 16].

Recovery Strategies
The performance capacity of an athlete depends on an
optimal balance between training and recovery. While
sleep and nutrition are fundamental for the restoration
of daily life and the recovery process following physical
exercise [142‚Äì144], several recovery strategies have been
explored to improve recovery in athletes. Within leading
sprinting communities, so-called tempo runs (100‚Äì
300 m running with brief recoveries and intensity 60‚Äì
70% of maximal sprint velocity) are commonly used between days of high-intensive training to loosen up stiff
muscles and improve cardiovascular fitness [10, 11, 13‚Äì
18]. (Note that tempo runs in a sprint training setting
are different to those in endurance training settings).
Total volume per training session is typically ~ 2000 m
during the preparation period and ~ 1000 m during the
competition period [13‚Äì16]. Although the scientific evidence for post-exercise recovery purposes is limited
[145‚Äì148], tempo runs contribute to a total training volume that may increase the athletes‚Äô trainability and durability in the long term.
A number of passive recovery modalities have also
been applied by practitioners over the years, including
massage, stretching, compression garments, cold water
or contrast water immersion, cryotherapy, hyperbaric
oxygen therapy, and electromyostimulation [11, 13, 14].
While there may be some subjective benefits for postexercise recovery, there is currently no convincing evidence to justify the widespread use of such strategies in

Page 11 of 16

competitive athletes [142, 146, 149‚Äì162]. Placebo effects
may be beneficial, and at the individual level, certain recovery modalities may elicit reproducible acceleration of
recovery processes. Future studies of experimental
models designed to reflect the circumstances of elite athletes are needed to gain further insights regarding the efficacy of various recovery modalities on sprint
performance.

Tapering
Tapering refers to the marked reduction of total training
load in the final days before an important competition.
Tapering strategies consist of a short-term balancing act,
reducing the cumulative effects of fatigue, but maintaining fitness [163, 164]. Because tapering strategies and
outcomes are heavily dependent on the preceding training load, it is often challenging to separate tapering from
periodization and training programming in general. According to several authors, a realistic performance goal
for the final taper should be a competition performance
improvement of about 2‚Äì3%. However, these estimates
are mainly based on well-trained athletes in endurance(swimming, running, cycling) or strength-related sports
[163‚Äì168]. Based on individual performance variation
data in elite sprinters [5, 69], it is reasonable to expect
smaller relative tapering effects for sprinting athletes.
The general scientific guidelines for a likely effective
taper in strength- and power-related sports are a 2- to
3-week period incorporating 40‚Äì60% reduction in training volume following a progressive non-linear format,
while training intensity and frequency are maintained or
only slightly reduced [169‚Äì171]. The strategies employed
by successful track and field are generally consistent
with research [172]. The 10-day taper program developed by Charlie Francis has received considerable attention within the sprinting community [13, 14] (Table 5).
Here, provided that the preceding workout the last 6‚Äì8
weeks has been performed according to plan (no injuries
or disease), the last extensive and high-intensive sprint
session is performed 10 days prior to the most important
competition of the year, then followed by easy sprint
training sessions (low volume at 95% velocity) 8, 6, 4,
and 2 days before competition. Stephen Francis argues
for a slightly different approach, mainly decreasing the
volume by 30% over the last 10 days before a major
competition [10]. His most successful athlete, Asafa
Powell, achieved world record performances in June as
well as September.
Given that there are several roads to Rome in terms of
tapering, it is generally accepted that the training during
this period should be highly specific. That is, only exercises that directly assist sports performance should remain, while accessory work and assistance exercises
should be removed from the training prescription [169,

171, 172]. Moreover, the number of technical inputs
should be kept to a minimum to prepare the athletes mentally and build confidence. Successful coaches adapt a holistic strategy where physiological, technical, and mental
aspects are integrated into the tapering process [172]. The
individualized approach is consistent with discussions of
coaching, reinforcing that not all athletes are the same,
nor are circumstances and contexts, and hence, a ‚Äúonesize-fits-all‚Äù approach is rarely appropriate.

Conclusions
This review has contrasted scientific and best practice
literature. Although the scientific literature provides
useful and general information regarding the development of sprint performance and underlying determinants, there is a considerable gap between science
and best practice in how training principles and
methods are applied (these gaps are summarized in
Table 6). Possible explanations for these discrepancies
may be that scientific studies mainly examine isolated
variables under standardized conditions, while best
practice is concerned about external validity and
apply a more holistic approach. In order to close this
gap between science and practice, future investigations should observe and assess elite sprinters
throughout the training year, aiming to establish

Table 6 Summary of the level of agreement between scientific and best practice literature
Training principle or
method

Scientific versus best practice literature

Progressive overload

Moderate agreement. Both scientific and best practice literature emphasize the importance of familiarization and gradual
progression to reduce injury risk and maximize performance. However, the influence of running surface and footwear as
specific modifiers of sprint training load is more highlighted within best practice.

Specificity

Poor agreement. Both scientific and best practice literature highlight the importance of sprint running and high-velocity
movements on sprint performance enhancement. However, there is a considerable gap in how the sprint specific training
components are applied (see, e.g., specific sprint training further down).

Variation/periodization

Poor agreement. Scientific studies mainly focus on traditional and block-training periodization, while alternative models (e.g.,
‚Äúlong-to-short‚Äù and ‚Äúshort-to-long‚Äù) are used within leading sprinting communities.

Individualization

Poor agreement. Most scientific interventions have applied a ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù approach, but recent studies have suggested
that training should be prescribed according to individual force-velocity profiles. Best practice focuses more on training pre
scription according to individual performance capacity, anthropometric factors, training status/age, sex, and recovery/injury
status.

Specific sprint training

Poor agreement. Most sprint-related studies are performed on young team sport players, consisting of brief and maximal
sprints with short recoveries. In contrast, elite sprinters perform sprint-specific training with varying distances, intensities and
recoveries.

Technical training

Poor agreement. Very few scientific studies are devoted to how optimal sprinting mechanics can be achieved. The best
practitioners apply sprint drills to reinforce the technical work and isolate specific movement features.

Strength and power
training

Good agreement. There are no major discrepancies in sprint-related strength- and power training recommendations when
comparing scientific and best practice literature.

Plyometric training

Good agreement. Both scientific and best practice literature encourage sprinters to use different types of high-intensive
bounding, jumping and skipping exercises for developing leg stiffness and horizontal power production.

Recovery strategies

Poor agreement. Best practice applies several passive and active post-exercise recovery modalities (massage, compression
garments, cold water immersion, cryotherapy, tempo runs, etc.), although the scientific evidence for these strategies is
limited.

Tapering

Good agreement. The tapering strategies employed by the best practitioners are generally consistent with research,
although best practice literature provides more detailed information.

drawn in this review may serve as a position statement and provide a point of departure for forthcoming studies regarding sprint training of elite athletic
