1. Introduction
Basketball is one the most popular indoor games. It is played widely in the world. Nowadays; it has become more
brisk by the changes of some rules. In the last 30 years, it can been seen that basketball players has changed
physically and physiologically and comparing to 1970â€™s and 1980â€™s, current players are more improved in terms of
physical and biomotor skills (Foran& Pound 2007). Adaption of improving technology and technological tools to
testing and evaluation methods in sport science have given opportunity to study the activities that cause physical
stress during basketball competitions and response of players to this stress. Thus, they have knowledge about the
physical and physiological needs of players during the competitions and reviewed the basics of the game. The
biggest reason of this development is that the coach use training methods specific to basketball through the increase
in the level of his knowledge (Sevim, 2010).
In studies, anthropometric and physiological profile of the successful players have been evaluated. In the
evaluation of elite-level basketball players, the parameters such as experience, body composition, strength, aerobic
and anaerobic power balance have been primarily evaluated among the other factors (Hoofman, 2003; Scheller&
Rask, 1993).
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of 8 weeks basketball training on the physical and physiological
parameters
2. Method
8ÃºDN6SRUWV,QFVSRUWVPHQDJHDYHUDJHr3,16 (years), height average 196,62r9,91 (cm), weight average
196,62r9,91 (cm) and bodyâ€“mass index 24,33r1,68 (kg/m2), taking part in Beko Basketball League, have
participated in this study. The measurements have been held in the preparation stage and the essential information
about test has been given to the all players before test runs.
2.1. Applied tests
2.1.1. Assessing the height and body weight
The height and body weight of research staff were measured with barefoot and wearing shorts. Secastadiometer
with 0,01 accuracy rating was used in the measurements.
2.1.2. Measuring the strength of grip hand, back and leg
TAKEI GRIP- D hand grip dynamometer with a measuring range from 0 to 100 kg was used. The dynamometer
was set according to the hand measurement of research staff. In the measurement, the research staff placed the arms
at the side, standing and without touching the body to the dynamometer and gripped the dynamometer as hard as
possible in one quick movement. Grip tests were performed twice on the right hand and then twice on left hand with
dynamometer. The best score was determined in kg. In the measurement of back-leg, dynamometers were adjusted
so that the participants were squatted over the dynamometer with knees and they could hold without bending their
elbows. The best of two measurements was determined as kg.
2.1.3. Flexibility
Sit and reach test was carried out by using flexibility table. It was assessed twice in a seated position without
bending knees. The best distance was recorded in cm.
2.1.4. Aerobic power
It was measured with 20 metres shuttle running test. In basketball court, the required distance was limited by
using a steel tape 20 metres long. Upon hearing pre-recorded audiocassette tape, the male basketball players started

1289

1290

Yucel Ocak et al. / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 152 (2014) 1288 â€“ 1292

to run both start-finish line. MaxVO2 levels in assessment table were estimated in (ml/kg/dk.) based on the recorded
repetition number.
2.1.5. Vertical Jump / Anaerobic Power
The measurement was held by using Newtest 3000 electronic jump tester. The assessment was done, when the
subjectâ€™s feet were open in shoulder width, body was flexed to 90 degrees from knees, bend to front, the arms were
at side. The assessment was performed three times. The best score was recorded in cm. Anaerobic power value (kgm/sn.) was assessed by applying Lewis formula to the jump distance.

2.1.6. The measuring the blood lactate level
The blood lactate level has been measured with Lactate Scout blood lactate analyser. Before starting to the test,
the measurement has been carried out to understand the lactate level at rest. Then, lactate measurement has been held
just after 20 metres shuttle running test and 3 minutes after the test. Such measurement has been performed by
obtaining blood samples from tip of either middle or ring finger. Firstly the tip of fingers is disinfected and then by
means of lancet, drop of blood is developed (the first blood drop was wiped off and the second is used in the test).
Lactate level is assessed with strip. Before the measurements, calibration of lactate analyzer has been supplied with
control drop.
2.1.7. Pulmonary function test run
Spirometric analyses have been performed with Chestgraph HI-105 spirometer to the research group. All athletes
have kept in seated position during all process. It has been managed during the test that sportsmen donâ€™t cough, test
doesnâ€™t finish early. The sportsmen put the mouthpiece in their mouth, lightly bite the mouthpiece and close lips
around it. They are firstly asked for breathing normally for three times. Then the sportsmen are expected to take a
deep breath in their maximum level and after waiting a few seconds to breathe out as fast as they can. Test is
technically acceptable. It has been performed at least three times. The highest FVC and FEV1 values have been
selected among three different obtained curves.
2.2. Statistical Analysis
In the evaluation of obtained data, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test has been used. It is a non-parametric test.
Confidence interval has been selected as %95 and the values equal and below p<0,05 have been accepted as
meaningful actuarially.

4. Discussion
According to the findings of research, the average age of the participant players has been identified as 26,00r3,16
(year). According to Acarbay et al., (1996) the average age for players in the 1st league basketball team 21,37Â±1,90
years. According to Kuter and Ozturk, (1992) the average age of elite Turkish male basketball players has been
reported as 23Â±5 years. In these studies, the data obtained about the age has been found higher than earlier
researches. It is thought that Beko Basketball League is a league at the highest level and it requires experience in
addition to technical and tactical skills.
The average body weight has been identified as 94,33r14,18 (kg) and also, the average body height identified
as 196,62r9,91 (cm.). Pamuk et al., (2008) have identified the average height for 2nd League and Regional League
players as 195,10Â±0,08 cm and their average body weight as 91,75Â±12,99 kg. Coleman et al., (1972) have reported
the average height of American basketball players as 191.10 cm. In another study, the average height and weight of
the Hungarian basketball players have been identified respectively as 192,10 cm and 84,80 kg (CsanÃ¡dy, Forster,
&HÃ¶gye, 1986). According to Bale and Scholes, (1986) the average height of British basketball league players is
191,00Â±10,10 cm. In a study, the average height of Turkish basketball players has been identified as 196,30 Â± 5,80
cm and average body weight as 91,00Â±6,80 kg (Kuter&Ozturk, 1992). In this study, it is found that there is a
correlation between the values of height and weight of Beko Basketball League players and the earlier ones.
According to Table.2, Significant variations between aerobic power, anaerobic power, lactate levels three minutes
after the training, the values of back-leg strength, flexibility, FVC, FEV1 values have been seen (p<0,05) which is
based on the 8 week basketball workout process in preparation period. On the other hand, it has been determined that
there is no statistically significant variation between lactate after the workout, the strength of right and left grip and
FEV1/FVC values. (p>0,05).
In this study, average MaxVO2 for playershas been identified as 48,14r3,82 before preparation stage while such
average has been 52,69r3,92 after training. In the study during competition period Pamuk et al., (2008) has found
that the average MaxVO2 for players in 2nd League is 50.80Â±11.57 ml/kg/min., while the average MaxVO2 for
Regional League players is 46.65Â±3.97 ml/kg/min. Laplaud et al., (2004) have identified that the average maximal

1292

Yucel Ocak et al. / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 152 (2014) 1288 â€“ 1292

oxygen uptake for professional basketball players is 44.10 ml/kg/min. Gocentas et al., (2005) have reported that
average value of maximal oxygen uptake for international professional basketball players is 48.90 ml/kg/min. Such
obtained data are in line with the data in our research.
During preparation stage, the average grip power of players is 55,25r8,69 kg for right hand and 53,98r8,27 kg
for left hand. In the end of workout; it has been found that it is 57,15r10,53 kg for right hand and 52,50r9,04 kg for
left hand (Table 2). Considering these values, there is no significant difference in right and left hand grip power
(p>0.05). The characteristic of applied training programme may have affected the performance parameters.
It has been found that before preparation stage, the average anaerobic power is 163,25r22,85 kgm/sec. After
training, it has become 169,08r20,54 kgm/sec. Upon examining the resources, medium level anaerobic power value
of players between 20 and 30 year old has been identified as 140-175 kgm/sec. and high level ones has also been
identified as 176-210 kgm/sec. (Erol, 1992). Latin et al., (1994) has made a research to determine the average
vertical jump value of male basketball players in NCAA 1st league. They have acquired the average vertical jump
height as 71.40 cm. It has been stated that the vertical jump power for such players is 170,28kgm/sec on average. In
the research by Pamuk et al., (2008) it has been found that the value of anaerobic power for basketball players in 2nd
league is 170,33Â±22,59 kgm/sec. while such value for players in regional league is 156,78Â±17,27 kgm/sec. It has
been determined that the anaerobic for basketball players in 2nd league is significantly higher than the ones in
regional league. In the light of these findings, it can be stated in our study that the players in Beko Basketball League
achieve higher anaerobic power but they are lower according to the values of American League.
In our study, It has been established that lactate level before preparation stage is 15,41r5,65. It is seen that these
values has reduced to 11,57r4,88 by means of 8 week-workouts.
As a result, it is determined that some physical and physiological skills of players have been developed thanks to
8 week basketball specific workout. Thus, it has been concluded that the recovery time has been shortened and precontest readiness level has been improved by increasing lactate tolerance.
