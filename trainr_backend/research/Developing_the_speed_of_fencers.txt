ABSTRACT
Background. The fencing assault is a fight between two competitors, in which they alternate the offensive with the
defensive attitude while attacking and retreating in the hope that one will strike the other with the tip of the blade, with
impressive speed and precision. The fencer who is faster will have the advantage of scoring touch and has a better
chance of winning the competition. Objectives. This study aims to verify whether training programs that use both nonspecific and specific fencing exercises develop the speed of fencers at the level of the lower and upper limbs. Methods.
The study subjects were divided into two homogeneous groups. The experimental group consisted of 10 athletes (5
boys and 5 girls), and the control group also included 10 athletes (5 boys and 5 girls). The experimental group followed
a training program including one set of exercises to develop limb speed, the set of exercises being different every
month, with a total duration of the intervention of 3 months; the control group followed traditional training, without
emphasizing the development of the limb speed. Results. After three months of training, we could notice a significant
difference between the two groups in terms of defining the speed of the athletes’ lower and upper limbs. Conclusion.
Considering the results obtained from the tests, we can state that the innovative and different training methods
significantly developed the speed of the fencers in the experimental group.

INTRODUCTION
In different fields of sports, athletes must react
rapidly to different stimuli (tactile, visual, and audio).
As previously demonstrated by Borysiuk and
Waskiewicz (1), the major types of stimuli in fencing
are tactile and visual. Fencing is a sport in which
speed is a crucial component of performance (2).
Sorel (3) highlighted the importance of high levels of
coordination, explosive force, speed, accuracy, and
rapidity in the case of fencers. Fast reaction, which is
closely related to the visual or tactile stimuli

processing, muscle coordination during movement,
technical and tactical abilities, or optimal mental state
represent the elementary determinants influencing
the overall performance in fencing (4). Fencers are
exposed to a variety of stimuli (mainly visual and
tactile) during their training or matches in
tournaments which means that fencing can be
considered a sports discipline where the reaction time
is a significant component of the overall speed of the
offensive and defensive actions (4). Fencing not only

2

Developing the Speed of Fencers

involves a rapid change of position and wellcoordinated movements of the dominant hand but
also fast movements and good physical training.
These elements are required to perform technical and
tactical techniques and achieve high sports results (5).
Considering that speed and accuracy of
movement have been demonstrated to be related
to fencing performance (6), workouts consist of
training power and repeated changes of direction,
to improve the fencing performance (7).
Fencing requires quick responses and
powerful reactions. A fencer who does not
possess these skills will find it difficult to keep up
with his/her opponents and will have to make an
enormous effort to develop them as they are
closely related to the accuracy of the fencer’s
offensive actions.
Speed is a determining factor suggesting the
quality of an attack or defense made by the
competitor using different moves accompanied
by sudden changes or implementing another
move while fighting, which requires quick
response skills. He/she must take the right
decision, at the right time, by using confusion and
evasion to have an effective attack against the
opponent. Therefore, the required speed of the
motor response differs from one assault to the
other, depending on the technical and tactical
requirements of each fencer and according to the
changes that occur during an assault. The
importance of a quick response is undeniable in
fencing, the shorter the motor response time, the
higher the level of physical performance will be,
leading to a better result (8).
Fencing is a sport that relies on a complex
interplay
of
numerous
performance
characteristics. The evaluation of these
characteristics is important in the field of talent
identification
and
talent
development.
Multidimensional test batteries have proven their
value in different sports (9). The device (i.e.
Favero EFT-1) was found to be highly reliable
and therefore could be used in fencing athletes as
an additional test with ecological validity, and by
inference, as an additional training tool. Future
studies should aim to investigate the use of this
device as a training tool (10).
The objectives of this study were the
development of the fencers’ speed at the level of
upper and lower limbs by applying innovative
training methods consisting of specific and nonspecific fencing exercises, the identification of
different functional methods for the development

of speed, and the evaluation of their effectiveness
in the athletes’ training.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants. Athletes from the ACS Floreta
fencing club Timișoara, aged between 10 and 14,
participated in this study. The athletes’
parents/legal guardians gave their written consent
for the athletes’ participation in the study. In the
research process to be as real and valuable as
possible, the research subjects had to be selected
according to certain inclusion and exclusion
criteria. The criteria were divided into two
categories. These criteria were the following:
a) Inclusion criteria:
● Subjects must be aged between 10 and 14
years at the time of selection;
● They should have at least 6 months of
experience in fencing;
● They must have the written consent of their
parents/legal guardians for their participation
in the study.
b) Exclusion criteria:
● The unmotivated absence from training
sessions (not more than 4 times/month) and
tests;
● The excused absence from more than 4
training sessions (one month, in a cumulated
form) during the whole study. This kind of
absence can be encountered in the context of
competitions, training camps, school exams,
or the occurrence of some illnesses.
The athletes were divided into two groups: the
experimental group (10 athletes: 5 boys and 5
girls) and the control group (10 athletes: 5 boys
and 5 girls). The groups were homogeneous in
terms of age, gender, and training level, and the
allocation was done randomly, by drawing lots,
both for girls and boys.
The athletes in the experimental group
followed a program consisting in specific fencing
training which includes a set of exercises for
speed development, twice a week, general fitness
training, and one more specific fencing training
combined with assaults (either themed or free
assaults). As a whole, the experimental group had
4 training sessions per week, see Table 1.
The intervention. For each month (Tables 24) a set of 10 exercises was developed for speed
development, alternating their action areas (the
upper and lower limbs). This set of exercises
contains both fencing-specific exercises and
exercises borrowed from other sports. There were

Developing the speed of fencers

exercises in which certain helpful objects were
used (tennis balls, reaction balls, agility ladders,
sticks, cones, etc.), but there were also free
exercises.

The group control benefited from a general
training program, without any specific training in
speed development, with a total of 4 pieces of
training per week.

Measurement. At the beginning of the
research, baseline tests were conducted both for
the experimental and the control group. To
measure the speed of the upper limbs we used the
Favero EFT-1 device, and we evaluated the
reaction speed at the level of lower limbs with the
Optojump Next device.
Favero EFT-1. Favero EFT-1 (Figure 1a) – is

the trainer can prepare 9 different exercises (11).
The execution of the test: the athlete is in the
guard position which also implies the position of
the arm to be in sixth (the arm is bent and parallel
to the ground), at an optimal distance to hit with
an arm extension from the apparatus (figure 1b).
The device is turned on by the trainer, and the
athlete is waiting for the luminous signal. When
the red light appears, the timer on the device starts
automatically, and the athlete must strike in the
shortest time. If the strike was successful, the red
light turns off and the green light turns on.

trainer, and the athlete is waiting for the
luminous signal. When the red light appears,
the timer on the device starts automatically, and
the athlete must strike in the shortest time. If the
strike was successful, the red light turns off and
the green light turns on.

Developing the speed of fencers

Considering the programs on the device, we
have chosen programs 1, 5, and 7 for testing. In
program no. 1, the athlete must hit each target
(maximum time - 1.30 s), with a total of 10
strikes. In program no. 5, the athlete must hit two
consecutive targets (maximum time - 2.5 s),
similarly to the first program, i.e.10 times. And in
program no. 7, there are 3 consecutive targets
(maximum time - 3 s), also 10 times, similar to
programs 1 and 5.
Optojump Next. Optojump Next (Figure 2a)
– is an innovative system of analysis and
measurement which, in fencing, allows the
measurement of the reaction speed and movement
time, necessary for the fast performance of the
lunge, while showing us how long it takes to

5

perform a lunge. The execution of the test: the
athlete is in the guard position, with the heel of
the front foot (the skilled one) at the
predetermined line, between the two plates of the
device. The laptop, with the program turned on, is
one meter away from the athlete, at the level of
his/her face. The test is started by the coach and
from this moment a red dot appears in the
program; the athlete is waiting for the moment
when the red dot changes into a green one, and
this is the signal to lunge (Figure 2b). The waiting
time for the green dot is randomized by the
program. As soon as the athlete reaches the
ground again, with the front foot, the program
records the results which can be subsequently
exported into an Excel table (12).

RESULTS
The results recorded at the initial and final tests
were registered in tables 5-9, processed statistically,
and represented graphically (figures 3-5). Tables 57 show the evolution of the upper limb speed in

the experimental group of programs P1, P5, and
P7, and we can notice significant differences
(p<0.05) between the initial and final tests for all
3 programs.

Regarding the development of the lower limb
speed, in Table 8 we have the data referring to the
experimental group at the initial testing, using the
Optojump Next device, and in Table 9 we can see
the data of the final testing. After applying the
intervention, we can notice a relevant difference
regarding the three evaluated indices (the reaction
time, total time required to perform a lunge, and
lunge speed), the statistical „p” being lower than
the significance threshold.
Comparing the results of the groups, we have
obtained the following data: at the initial testing
(M0) there were no significant differences
between the groups in any parameter evaluated
(figures 3-5). Considering the evolution of the

average reaction time of the groups (when
lunging) (figure 3), we can notice a significant
difference between the two groups established
right after the first month of specific training; The
average of the total time needed to perform the
lunge also evolves in the same way (figure 4),
showing a significant difference between the
groups right after the first month of training
(p=0.0137). Regarding the average speed of the
lunge (figure 5), we can observe a significant
difference between the groups, as in the first two
parameters, after the first month of training. After
the three months of specific training, these
significant differences between the groups were
maintained.

DISCUSSION
Considering the test results, we can state that
the objectives of the research were achieved, and
the athletes’ speed was improved both in the
lower and upper limbs. We have also found
different effective methods for developing speed,
based on the combination of non-specific and
specific exercises in the context of fencing, and
the electronic systems used, which proved to be
useful both in the training program and in the
athletes’ testing. The positive result is due to both
fencing non-specific and specific exercises.

According to several studies published in
recent years, the development and testing of
fencing speed have benefited from the consistent
contribution of dedicated devices, the Favero
EFT-1 device being one of the most used ones (1,
10, 13). Moreover, De Georgio et al. (10)
demonstrated the reliability and validity of this
device in testing athletes as well.
Thus, we considered it necessary to use this device
both in the training for the development of the upper
limb speed of young fencers and in its evaluation.

The 3-month testing provided us with some
interesting information regarding the evolution of
the upper limb speed of the fencers in the two
groups; thus, if in the case of the initial testing,
there were no significant differences between the
contexts of the two groups in any of the programs
used on the Favero EFT-1 device, this aspect
changed during the intervention. The Favero
EFT-1 device, like in the studies conducted by
Balkó (1), Patial (14), Witkowski (15), and
Witkowski (16), was also introduced in the speed
development program and we can say that it had
a positive impact on the upper limb speed
development. After one month of training, we
noticed significant differences between the two
groups in program no. 1 (p=0.0428). Regarding
programs no. 5 and 7, we noticed significant
differences after the second month of training. At
the end of the intervention, after the three months
of training, there were significant differences
between the groups in all three programs
(p=0.0341 in program 1, p=0.034 in program 5,
and p=0.0158 in program 7). We can say that
these differences between the groups appeared
after the intervention.
We used the Optojump Next to test the lower
limbs, and this device allowed us to evaluate the
following parameters: the reaction time, the total
time needed to perform the lunge, and the speed
of the lunge. As we have not found any other
studies that used the Optojump Next device,
connected to the idea of the lunge, we cannot
make any comparisons. However, there are

studies in which it was also used to evaluate
different types of jumps, for example, CMJ and
SLCMJ (17, 18); SJ, CMJ, and 7R-HOP (7); SJ,
CMJ, and DJ (19), and also for the measurement
of the flight time (19, 20).
As Turner also specifies (21), the fencing
lunge is an offensive movement in which the
success of the action depends on the speed of
execution. We found it appropriate to assess the
lunge speed using the Optojump Next device, as
this is a fencing-specific movement, and we
consider that if we keep monitoring it we can
gather extremely useful data regarding the
contribution of the lower limbs in the fencingspecific actions. With the help of this device, we
can obtain concrete and objective data regarding
the lunge by evaluating the speed of reaction to a
visual stimulus, the time of the flight, and the total
time needed to perform the lunge, and by
measuring the length of the lunge we can
calculate the speed of its execution. These
parameters are indispensable for an objective
analysis of the lunge speed.
Considering the initial testing, there were no
significant differences between the groups in any
of the parameters assessed. Given the evolution of
the reaction times in the case of the two groups,
we can notice a relevant difference between them,
which materialized right after the first month of
intervention. The total times required to perform
the lunges evolved similarly, showing a
significant difference between the groups after the
first month of training (p=0.0137).

10

Developing the Speed of Fencers

Regarding the lunge speed of execution, the
significant differences between the two groups
also emerged after the first month, as in the case
of the first two parameters. After the three months
of specific training, these significant differences
between the groups were maintained.
Numerous studies have shown significant
results in the improvement of fencing speed.
Many researchers are dealing with the
development of reaction speed, specifying that it
develops between the ages of 11 and 14 (1). What
is interesting to note is that many researchers talk
about speed (measured in m/s), although the
evaluated parameters are at times (measured in s).
A more in-depth analysis of this approach and its
implication in the interpretation thereof would be
desirable. In principle, if we discuss the
individual results, given the fact that the
movement distance is approximately the same in
the case of the same individual, the speed is
similar; Yet, when comparing the results of the
times between two different fencers, where the
displacement differs (especially due to
anthropometric differences), the value of the
speed will not be calculated from the same
distance, so we cannot equate the comparison of
times with that of speed .
Improving the system of training young fencers
requires finding and justifying new forms of
organization of the training process based on
modern scientific achievements. Physical training
in fencing is one of the most important components
of sports training. It depends on a quick start,
maneuvering on the fencing track, a long wait for
a successful moment of attack, and the ability to
immediately make the right decisions (5).
The ability to influence reaction time is
difficult, and authors have reported varied
findings in this regard. Wang states that the level
of simple reaction time can be efficiently
influenced by training. The critically sensitive
period for reaction time improvement occurs at
approximately 13 – 14 years of age (1).
Poliszczuk (22) emphasizes the importance of
developing a speed of response to both auditory
and visual stimuli. Petronijevic (23) underlines
the role of speed in the work of the fencer’s hands.
Torun (24), similarly to the study herein, used
both specific and non-specific exercises in speed
training, with significant results both in the upper
and lower limbs .
We consider that the strengths of our study are
the following: there are not many studies in the

field of fencing, and only some of these focus on
fencing speed; The introduction of the Optojump
Next device in the methods of evaluation, as this
has never been used in the field of fencing to test
the lunge; the particularities of the intervention
carried out in the group of study, comprising three
different sets of exercises during three months.
As the limitations of our study, we can
mention that we had a relatively small number of
subjects and that we did not check to see if the
increase in the speed of the upper and lower limbs
was reflected in the improvement of the athletic
performance in the case of the analyzed fencers.
The latter may be an objective of further research.
Also, considering the age of participants perhaps
could have been added dietary recommendations.

CONCLUSION
The use of electronic training devices in the
specific training of young fencers and the addition
of specific exercises for the development of the
upper and lower limb speed determine its increase
while also resulting in the improvement of sports
performance.

APPLICABLE REMARKS

 Coaches need to have access to several types
of training that develop fencers' speed. In this
study, we also described the complete training
method.
 This research supports that the sets of specific
and nonspecific exercises included in fencers'
training improved their speed at the level of
upper and lower limbs.
 Also, the electronic devices used for testing and
developing the speed were practical and efficient.
