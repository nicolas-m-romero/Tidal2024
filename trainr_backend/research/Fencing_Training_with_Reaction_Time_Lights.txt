ABSTRACT

Objective: evaluate different reaction times in fencing training with reaction time lights
Method: This manuscript proposes four specific exercises for evaluating the simple reaction time (SRT), the elective reaction time (ERT), the
go/no-go response time (G/NG) and the decision decision-making after lunge (DML), march (DMM) and braking (DMB) in fencers. The
sample consisted of 48 fencers (22 males and 17 females; age: 21 ± 13 years) from several fencing clubs in the region of Andalusia, competing
at amateur (10 athletes), regional (17 athletes), national (7 athletes), and international (5 athletes) in the three official fencing weapons: Epee
(E), Saber (S), and Foil (F). The exercises were developed for the Queling Sport lighting system, connected by Bluetooth with the ReactionX
android application, which controlled the activation of the lights and recorded the reaction time and the correction of the execution for each
trial.
Results: The results by gender did not show significant differences. Considering the results by weapon, the foil fencers were fastest than saber
fencers, in all the exercises, but they were only significantly faster in the DML and DMM exercises. The performance in all the exercises was
directly related with the competition level of the fencer, but only significantly better in foil fencers than in sable fencers when the exercise
required decision-making processes.
Conclusions: We propose a reference scale to evaluate the perceptive ability of the fencers that could be applied in talent detection processes
and for evaluating the specific perceptive ability of the fencers.

RESUMEN

Objetivo: evaluar diferentes tiempos de reacción en el entrenamiento de esgrima con luces de tiempo de reacción.
Método: Este manuscrito propone cuatro ejercicios específicos para evaluar el tiempo de reacción simple (SRT), el tiempo de reacción electivo
(ERT), el tiempo de respuesta ir/no ir (G/NG) y la toma de decisiones en ejercicios básicos de esgrima como el fondo (DML), la marcha (DMM)

de la región de Andalucía, que competían en las categorías amateur (10 deportistas), autonómica (17 deportistas), nacional (7 deportistas), e
internacional (5 atletas) en las tres armas oficiales de esgrima: espada (E), sable (S) y florete (F). Los ejercicios fueron desarrollados para el
sistema de iluminación Queling Sport, conectado por Bluetooth con la aplicación android ReactionX, que controlaba la activación de las luces y
registraba el tiempo de reacción y la corrección de la ejecución para cada prueba.
Resultados: Los resultados por género no mostraron diferencias significativas. Considerando los resultados por arma, los esgrimistas con florete
fueron más rápidos que los esgrimistas con sable en todos los ejercicios, pero sólo fueron significativamente más rápidos en los ejercicios
DML y DMM. El rendimiento en todos los ejercicios estuvo directamente relacionado con el nivel de competición del tirador, pero sólo
significativamente mejor en los tiradores de florete que en los de sable cuando el ejercicio requirió procesos de toma de decisiones.
Conclusiones: Proponemos una escala de referencia para evaluar la capacidad perceptiva de los tiradores que podría ser aplicada en procesos de
detección de talentos y para evaluar la capacidad perceptiva específica de los tiradores.

Treinamento de esgrima com luzes de tempo de reação
RESUMO

Objetivo: avaliar diferentes tempos de reação no treinamento de esgrima com tempos de reação.
Método: Este manuscrito propõe quatro exercícios específicos para avaliar o tempo de reação simples (SRT), o tempo de reação eletivo (ERT),
o tempo de resposta ir/não ir (G/NG) e a tomada de decisões em exercícios básicos de esgrima como el fundo (DML), la marcha (DMM) e
romper (DMB). A mostra foi formada por 48 tiradores (22 homens e 17 mulheres; idade: 21 ± 13 anos) de vários clubes de esgrima da região da
Andaluzia, que competiram nas categorias amador (10 desportistas), autonómico (17 desportistas), nacional (7 desportistas), e internacionais
(5 atletas) nas três armas oficiais de esgrima: espada (E), zibelina (S) e florete (F). Os comandos foram desenvolvidos para o sistema de
iluminação Queling Sport, conectado por Bluetooth ao aplicativo Android ReactionX, que controlava a ativação das luzes e registrava o tempo
de reação e a correção da execução para cada teste.
Resultados: Os resultados por género não mostram diferenças significativas. Considerando os resultados por arma, os esgrimistas com florete
foram mais rápidos do que os esgrimistas com sable em todos os exercícios, mas só foram significativamente mais rápidos nos exercícios DML
e DMM. O desempenho em todos os exercícios está diretamente relacionado ao nível de competição do tirador, mas só é significativamente
melhor nos tiradores de florete do que nos de zibelina quando o exercício exige processos de tomada de decisão.
Conclusões: Propomos uma escala de referência para avaliar a capacidade perceptiva dos tiradores que poderia ser aplicada em processos de
detecção de talentos e para avaliar a capacidade perceptiva específica dos tiradores.

Introduction
Fencing is one of the oldest sports, as it was created in the 16th
century1. The traditional rules were gradually transformed to create
modern fencing in the late 19th century, becoming one of the first
Olympic sports. The International Fencing Federation (Fédération
Internationale d'Escrime, FIE) prescribes very strict standards2 for
the organization of fencing competition.
Fencing practice essentially involves touching the opponent in
the fastest and most precise manner while avoiding being touched
in return. So that, precision and speed of the movements and ability
to react to the actions of the opponent are crucial for improving
the performance in this sport, both for the amateur athlete and the
high-performance athlete3.
Sports vision involves a comprehensive visual analysis,
including a complete assessment of the athlete's visual skills, not
only visual acuity but also other skills relevant to the sport. After
the initial evaluation, sports optometrists can assist fencers by
prescribing optical compensation, whether glasses or contact lenses,
to reach the visual skill up to the maximum levels. Additionally,
they can provide fencers with vision training exercises and other
techniques for improving their visual skills and enhance their
performance on the track4.
This visual training involves the use of many techniques
and exercises specifically designed to improve visual skills as handeye coordination, visual reaction time, and dynamic visual acuity5.
Currently, several digital devices are used for training the visual skills
on athletes, including virtual reality goggles6, stroboscopic eyewear7,
and devices with lights8.
Fencing is very fast and visually demanding sport that requires
quick reflexes, excellent hand-eye coordination, and the ability to
anticipate and react to an opponent's movements9. Therefore, not
only a good vision is essential for success in fencing, but also a good
use and application of the visual skills on the sport practice.
In recent studies, reaction time light systems having been used
for evaluating and training the visual skills of athletes. They consist
of a several LED illuminated devices controlled by a software that
have been installed in a tablet or personal computer and allows the
athlete to be shown many visual stimuli in a random manner10,11.
These devices are used as targets for the athlete, who must activate
or deactivate them according to the program's requirements. These
systems are designed to collect performance data related to visual,
cognitive, and dynamic reactions. They are primarily used as a
measurement instrument, but they can also serve as a training tool

to improve performance, primarily reaction time, movement time,
and other sensorimotor-cognitive abilities. They are portable and easy
to set up and use systems; characteristics that makes them a very
useful tool for both training and testing purposes12 in individual and
collective sports.
In this manuscript, we aim to showcase the possibilities of
applying digital devices in a programmed visual training, in order to
assist coaches to improve the sport performance. The main objective
of this study is to demonstrate that working the reaction time
with lighting systems allow coaches and athletes to know, measure,
and improve their reaction times. The secondary objectives include
designing exercises that athletes can transfer to real combat and
measuring reaction times as a starting point in a training program to
enhance shooters' performance.
Materials and Methods
Sample
The sample consisted of 48 fencers (22 males and 17 females;
age: 21 ± 13 years) from several fencing clubs in the region of
Andalusia, competing at amateur (10 athletes), regional (17 athletes),
national (7 athletes), and international (5 athletes) levels in the three
official fencing weapons: Epee (E), Saber (S), and Foil (F). The study
was conducted with the voluntary participation of all athletes after
signing an informed consent. The sample included 22 (45% of the
sample) fencers younger than 18 years, in those cases, the parental
consent was requested.
All the participants completed a previous anamnesis including
questions about health status and basic visual evaluation including,
among others, visual acuity and ocular motility. Subjects who
reported having health problems in the last week, had monocular
(right or left) visual acuity lower than 0.7, binocular visual acuity
lower than 0.8, and altered ocular motility were excluded from the
sample.
Materials
To carry out the data collection, we deployed two sets of four
Queling Sport lights (Queling China). The 8 lighting devices were
synchronized by Bluetooth version 5.0 with the ReactionX application
(Queling, China), designed for Android devices. The diameter of the
lighting devices is 9 cm and they were attached with Velcro to vertical

64

Msc Rafael Barañano-Alcaide et al. /Rev Andal Med Deporte.. 2024; 17(1-2)

panel of 1.6 x 1.0 meters with an image of a fencer (Figure 1). The
lighting devices have a maximum operational range of 35 to 40 meters
and a battery life of 3 hours. It is also worth noting the responsiveness
of the devices to diverse stimuli, including vibrational cues, tactile
interactions, close-range proximity (8 to 15 cm), or distal proximity
(30-40 cm). We selected the “tactile interaction” mode for this testing,
so that the device was activated only when any part of its surface was
touched.

Given the athlete's foreknowledge of the upcoming light,
anticipatory responses occasionally resulted. Responses faster than
100 ms were considered as anticipations and they were discarded.
Additionally, responses longer than 1000 ms were considered as
blockages of the fencers and they were also discarded.
The average number of trials (lights exhibited) in the minute
of testing was 33 ± 10, and the total number of discarded trials for
anticipation or blockage for all tested subjects was 33 (2.08% of the
trials).
Exercise 2 for Elective Reaction Time (ERT):

Figure 1. Arrangement of the lights as a target in all exercises. Positioned as
two lateral rights on the arm and left on the chest, one on the waist, and one
on the mask.

For carrying out the test in all the conditions, plastic weapons of
the same length as those used in actual combat were employed. These
weapons featured different grips, allowing athletes to choose the one
closer to their own combat weapon.
In addition, it was used a tablet running on the Android
operating system with the ReactionX application installed to control
and synchronize activation of the light systems and recording the
reaction times of the fencers in all the evaluated tasks.
Procedures
In collaboration with coaches, four exercises were designed
and conducted to systematically train reaction times and decisionmaking, simulating the controlled scenarios and actions that fencers
face during a bout. (See figure 1).
All measurements were taken during a fencing training session.
The duration of all the tested conditions (exercise 1 to 4) was around
10 minutes. All the exercises were explained and practiced for 3
minutes first with the hand, and later with the plastic weapon.
For all the exercises, the data provided by the system included
the results for all trials (times and correctness), the fastest, the
slowest, and the average of all trials. The quantity and color of the
lights for each trial were also indicated.
To test reaction abilities, four exercises were conducted, with
different levels of uncertainty:
Exercise 1 for Simple Reaction Time (SRT):
The ReactionX application was configured on the device in
"Order" mode, with lights positioned according to Figure 1. Only
one light, following a specific sequence known to the athlete, was
illuminated in a single color (green) and the fencer had to switch it
off with a contact of the weapon. The interval between the extinguish
of the light and the activation of the next light was randomized with
times between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds.
The fencer was positioned at a distance allowing them to reach
the lights with their weapon (typically around 80-90 cm, depending
on the athlete's height) and he/she started the test in a fencing guard
position with the weapon pointed towards the lights and the target
was to switch off the green lights as soon as possible when they
appear.

The ReactionX application was set to "Standard" mode, and
the reaction time lights were arranged as per the previous exercise
(Figure 1). Here, only one light out of the four illuminated randomly
in a single color, while all other configurations of the app were the
same that the preceding exercise. Athletes were requested to identify,
locate, and react for touching only the illuminated light as fast as
possible. Elective Reaction Time (ERT), was defined as the time
an individual takes to make a decision and respond to the visual
stimulus which, in this case, had four possible options.
Responses faster than 100 ms were considered as anticipations
and they were discarded. Additionally, responses longer than 1000
ms were considered as blockages of the fencers and they were also
discarded.
The average of trials (lights exhibited) in the minute of testing
were 27.69 ± 3.31 and the total number of discarded trials for
anticipation of blockage for all the tested subjects were 22 (1.61%
of the trials).
Exercise 3 Go/Non-Go Exercise (G/NG):
One of the main decisions a fencer must make is whether to
enter in striking distance, to increase the possibility of touching
during a bout. To assess this decision-making skill, the Reaction X
application was set in "True-False" mode. In each trial a single green
light (or none) was lightened with a 0.5-second delay between the
extinguishing of the previous trial. The rest of the lights (or the four)
were illuminated in red or yellow. In each trial, the lights remained
illuminated for a maximum of 2 seconds.
The fencer was asked to extinguish only the green lights and
disregarding lights of other colors. The sequence of the lights was
always randomized by the system. The fencer positioned themselves
at the same distance as in previous exercises, commencing from the
fencing guard position. In this exercise, we measured time included
apart from the elective reaction time, the go/non-go response time.
The fencer had to react to the colors of the lights to execute a touch
or to stay in the guard position. The application provided acoustic
feedback on incorrectly extinguished lights, as well as lights that were
missed.
Responses faster than 100 ms were considered as anticipations
and they were discarded. Additionally, responses longer than 1000
ms were considered as blockages of the fencers and they were also
dicharded.
The average of trials (lights exhibited) in the minute of testing
were 17.27 ± 3.61 and the total number of discarded trials for
anticipation of blockage for all the tested subjects were 3 (0.24% of
the trials).
Exercise 4 Decision-Making Exercise (DM)
This is an evolution of the previous exercise where the fencer
had to perform a specific type of exercise based on prior instructions,
depending on the color of the light observed. The Reaction X
application was configured on the device with the "Combined" mode.
Only one lamp out of the four would light up randomly with one
of the three predetermined colors (i.e. blue, red and green), each
associated with a specific movement.

General results
Table
1 summarizes the
mean values for each exercise for
the entire sample. We note that the
simple
reaction time (SRT1) was
(388 ± 146 ms), and the elective reaction
time

Note In exercises marked with “*” Kruskal-Wallis test (K-W) analysis is reported, in other cases Student’s T test (t) was applied.
When the lamp illuminated with green light, the subject had
to perform a lunge to touch the lights as quickly as possible (DML).
If the illuminated light was red, the subject executed a marching
movement to touch (DMM), and when the illuminated light was blue,
they had to perform a breaking movement before executing a march
or lunge to touch the activated device (DMB).
With the reaction time lights located in the same position as
the others exercise (Figure 1), the fencers stood in the guard position
at a distance from the lights that allowed them to touch the lights
by making a typical fencing displacement with the weapon (usually
about 100-120 cm from the target). In each module of the exercise (i.e.
DML, DMM and DMB), the times taken to turn off the lights for each
module were displayed.
Responses faster than 100 ms were considered as anticipations
and they were discarded. Additionally, responses longer than 2500
ms were considered as blockages of the fencers and they were also
discarded.
The average of trials (lights exhibited) in the minute of testing
were 9.85 ± 4.24 and the total number of discarded trials for
anticipation of blockage for all the tested subjects were 45 (3.17%
of the trials).
It must be noted that, both fencers and coaches, were more
interested in the fourth exercise as it closely resembled real combat.
Statistical Analysis
For the descriptive statistics, the average of all the attempts of
each exercise was obtained, after discarding the anticipated responses
and blockings.
The normality of all the considered variables was tested by the
Shapiro-Wilk test. The normality was assumed only for the results of
the DM4 exercises, but not the ERT, SRT and G/NG exercises. Given
the limited sample size, in the results section of the manuscript both
parametric and non-parametric test have been shown in the tables,
according to the sample distribution. For all the statistical test the
level of significance was set at α = 0.05)
Kruskal-Wallis test were done for searching differences on the
response times in the ERT, SRT and G/NG exercises by weapon, level
of the fencer and gender, applying standard post hoc test for defining
significant differences among groups.
ANOVA for independent samples were done for searching
differences on the response times by weapon and level of the fencer,
applying Tukey post hoc test for defining significant differences
among groups. Additionally, the η² was determined to define the
effect size, considering values <0.01 as small effect, values >0.01 and
<0.14 as medium effect and values >0.14 as high effect size.
Finally, Student’s t test for independent samples was run for
evaluating differences by gender in the results of the fourth exercise
(DM4), and Cohen d was indicated to express the effect size of the
differences by gender <0.2 as small effect, values >0.2 and <0.8 as
medium effect and values >0.8 as high effect size.
Results

(ERT2) was (543 ± 115 ms). The mean value for the go/no-go exercise
time (570 ± 79 ms) is quite similar to the elective reaction time. In the
decision-making exercises, the fastest movement was the lunge
(DML4) (1083± 185 ms), followed by the marching movement
(DMM4) (1325 ± 234 ms), and the slowest was the breaking (DMB4)
(16271 ± 268 ms).
Results by sex
The table 1 also displays the results separated by gender (males
and females). As can be observed the Kruskal-Wallis test or the
Student’s T test (depending in the character of the sample) do not
show significant differences between genders in all the exercises)
(p>0.05), and the results are quite similar without a clear trend on
the differences by gender.
Results by weapon
Table 2 shows the averaged values by the fencer’s weapon. The
ANOVA analysis pointed to significant differences only in the
decision-making exercises, in the DML4 (F=4.741; p<0.05) and DMM4
(F=6.196; p<0.05), but not in the DMB4 (F=1.073; p=0.350). When the
average of the three decision-making exercises were considered
(DM4), the results showed also significant differences by fencers
weapon (F=4.688; p<0.05). In all the cases, the Tukey post-hoc
analysis indicated that the significant differences were between Sabre
and Foil groups (p<0.05), with higher decision-making values in the
Sabre group and lower values in the Foil group. In all the cases, the
Eppe group had intermediate results without significant differences
among the other two groups.
Results by level of the fencer
In Table 3 is can be seen the average results by the level of the
fencer. The general trend of the results indicates the worst
performance (longer times) in amateur fencers, followed by regional
and national level fencers, with the best performance (shorter times)
seen in international level fencers. However, the one-way ANOVA or
Kruskal-Wallis analysis only exhibits significant differences (p<0.05)
for the ERT2 (K=8,649; p<0.05) and the DMM4 (F=4.539; p<0.05)
exercises, and for average of the three decision-making exercises
(DM4) (F=4.688; p<0.05). In all the cases, the Tukey post-hoc analysis
indicated significant differences were between the amateur and
international level fencers (p<0.05). Additionally, for the decisionmaking exercises (DMM4 and DM4) they were also found significant
differences between amateur and national level fencers (p<0.05).
Proposal of reference values
With all the registered data, we have created a proposal of
evaluation scale of the different exercises considered in the study
(Table 4), which can be used for estimating the score of any fencer on

evaluation scale, we have applied it to obtain the points of the average
values on each exercise for the four competition levels of fencers
(shown in Table 3).
Discussion
Reaction time lights are employed to enhance visual skills
across various sports. The analysis of reaction time and visual
anticipation should be integral to the design and implementation of
a visual training program aimed at improving athletes' visual skills
to enhance their sports performance13. They have demonstrated their

validity in specific training sessions for fencers of varying levels to
enhance the physical performance of fencers2,14,15.
Based on this premise and with the assistance of coaches, we
formulated specific exercises for evaluating the simple and elective
reaction time and decision-making in fencers. We will discuss the
obtained results, first in general and, later, according the gender, the
weapon and the level of the fencer and we will propose a draft of a
reference scale to establish the level of the fencers on those visual
skills.

General results
The general results indicated that the reaction and decisionmaking times are directly related to the difficulty of the task. The
fastest times corresponds to the SRT1 (388 ± 146 ms) because it was
used a single light and there is a lack of cognitive processing in the
task. The fencer just touched the light when it was switched on.
The second exercise in term of cognitive complexity was the
ERT2 (543± 115 ms), in which the fencers had four lights and they had
to touch only the light that it was switch on.
If we consider the SRT2 and ERT2 results, we can observe
the differences of the fencers’ reaction times between planned and
unplanned actions; when the fencers knew which light would be
illuminate (SRT1), the times were shorter than when they were
unaware (ERT1), these results are slightly different in absolute values
but similar with the findings from other researchers with other sport
and protocols10,16.
The results for third exercise G/NG3 were quite similar to the
ERT (570 ± 79 ms), similar to those found by other authors17 0.523
± 0.074 ms. At this point, it must be considered that, as it was
mentioned in the data collection protocol, the number of mistakes
or blockages in the ERT2 exercise was higher (22 discarded; 1,61% of
the whole) than in the G/NG3 (3 discarded; 0.24% of the whole). That
point is very important to interpreter the results because in the ERT2
exercise, the fencers started the movement when the four lights were
activated, and the action could be optimized during the movement of
the weapon. However, in the G/NG3 the action could not be corrected
once the movement was started, and it could not be modified the
trajectory of the weapon; so that, the decision-making had to be
completely and perfectly done before starting the action. Tasks such
as Go/No-Go, addressing choice and decision speed during exercise,
and they can identify defects in visuomotor control and balance that
may persist after recovery18.
The most difficult tasks from a cognitive point of view were
those included in exercise 4 (DML4, DMM4, DMB, and DM4 as
the average of the three tasks). Considering all the decision-making
exercises, we obtained results closely related to the technical aspects
of the movements required of the fencer, even when significant
differences between the exercises were not found. (p>0.05). The
fastest movement was the lunge (DML4) (1083± 185 ms), which is
the fastest attack in fencing, followed by the marching movement
(DMM4) (1325 ± 234 ms), and the slowest results were for the
breaking action (DMB4) (16271 ± 268 ms), because this movement
requires a previous step backwards before starting the attack action.
These times were higher than those obtained by other authors19
(1083± 185 ms vs. 601 ± 82ms); these differences may be due not only
to the different methodology of the studies, but also to the different
level of the fencers, as they had only had elite fencer of aiming
weapons: foil and epee, and in our sample we had also non-elite
level athletes including saber fencers. The saber fencers normally
touch with the edge of the weapon and they start from a different
guard position; these conditions were different to the requested in the
exercises. Other authors who measured accuracy and touch times in
fencing with a protocol similar to ours obtained closer exercise times
1336 ± 319 ms vs. 1680 ± 250 ms20,21 (1336 ± 319 ms vs. 1194 ± 86 ms)
Results by sex
The results separated by gender do not show significant
differences between males and females in any of the exercises.
(p>0.05), being the results quite similar in most of the exercises
without a clear trend on the differences by gender. Although other
authors also found no significant differences in attack speed between
gender with a sample of 9 males and 13 female young fencers
13.4±0.85 years old (men 3.6 ± 0.90 m/s and women 2.90 ± 0.72 m/s)4.

67

Other studies on fencing did show differences in the attack times of
men compared to those carried out by women22 with a sample of 13
men aged 25.9 ± 2.8 years and 13 women aged 25.8 ± 3.1 years foil
fencer finalists from the FIE competitions.
Results by weapon
When we analyze the data by weapon, the average values of the
foil fencers were the fastest, in all the exercises, being the differences
statistically faster than the sabre fencers in the decision-making
exercises DML4 (Foil= 999 ± 121 ms vs Sabre= 1192 ± 188 ms) (F=4.741;
p<0.05) and DMM4 (Foil= 1166 ± 210 ms vs Sabre= 1432 ± 211 ms)
(F=6.196; p<0.05), but not in the DMB4 (F=1.073; p=0.350). When
the average of the three decision-making exercises were considered
(DM4), the results showed also significant differences by fencers’
weapon (F=4.688; p<0.05), with higher decision-making values in the
sabre group and lower values in the foil group (Foil= 1250 ± 299
ms vs Sabre= 1446 ± 320 ms). In all the cases, the Eppe group had
intermediate results without significant differences among the other
two groups.
These results were expected because, although the Sabre fight
is faster, its touch requires less accuracy and the usual touch is with
the edge of the weapon, which is less accurate and not the requested
technique in the exercises. Besides, the sabre fencers start from a
different guard position, and they were not used the guard position
requested on the exercises. These times were higher than those
obtained (1110 ± 186 ms vs. 601 ± 82ms )19 for sword fencer, and (999±
121 ms and 1194 ± 86 ms)21 for foil fencers, because these authors
only had elite foil and epee fencers and in our sample were included
fencers of different practice levels including amateur fencers.
Results by level of the fencer
When the averages obtained in the four exercises were
separated by the level of competition of the athletes, The general
trend of the results indicates the worst performance (higher times)
in amateur fencers, followed by regional and national level fencers,
with the best performance (lower times) seen in international
level fencers, and the best results (lower times) were for the
international level fencers, like other authors found for different
sports (Van de Water et al., 2017). This is logical because the
faster and more accurate is an athlete, the better can qualify in
the championships; however, Kruskal-Wallis analysis only exhibited
significant differences (p<0.05) for the ERT2 between the amateur
fencer group and the international fencer group, (International= 479
± 71 ms vs Amateur= 620 ± 127 ms) (K=8.649; p<0.05).
When analyzed one way ANOVA, significant differences were
shown in the DMM4 exercises between the amateur fencer group
(1486 ± 156 ms) compared to the national (1180 ± 291 ms) and
international (1215 ± 226 ms) fencer groups (F=4.539; p<0.05), and
for average of the three decision-making exercises (DM4) with lower
times for the amateur group 1476 ± 363 ms) compared with the
International (1229 ± 241ms) and National (1277 ± 317 ms) groups
(F=4.688; p<0.05). In all the cases, the Tukey post-hoc analysis
indicated significant differences were between the amateur, and
national, international level fencers (p<0.05).
Application of the reference values
After evaluating the fencers on any of the exercises considered
in this manuscript, their results can be scored with the proposed
reference scale (Table 4). The example shown in the Table 5 allows
see in a glance that the level of performance is directly related with
the competition level of the fencer. This reference scale could also be
applied in processes of talent detection as an easy way to evaluate the

68

specific perceptive ability of the fencer, or to check the effect of the
perceptive trainings, just comparing the scores before and after the
intervention program.

Conclusions
This manuscript proposes four specific exercises for evaluating
the simple and elective reaction time and decision-making in fencers.
The general results indicate that the reaction and decision-making
times are directly related to the difficulty of the task. As other
previous studies, we confirm that the fastest times corresponds to
the SRT exercise followed by, at the same level by the ERT and G/NG3
exercise; however, the number of blockage and mistakes and the
technique of the required action must be considered in these cases.
The most difficult tasks from the cognitive point of view were
the decision-making exercises (DML, DMM and DMB) in which the
results are close related to technique of the movements requested to
the fencer. The fastest movement was the lunge (DML), followed by
the march (DMM) and the slowest was the breaking action (DMB).
The results separated by gender did not show significant
differences between males and females in all the exercises.
Considering the results by weapon, the foil fencers were faster than
the saber fencers in all exercises, but they were only significantly
faster in the DML and DMM exercises. In all the cases, the Eppe group
had intermediate results without significant differences among the
other two groups. Finally, when results were analyzed by the level
of competition, performance in the all exercises was directly related
with the competition level of the fencer.
We have edited a reference scale to evaluate the perceptive
ability of the fencers that could be applied in processes of talent
detection and for evaluating the specific perceptive ability of the
fencers.
