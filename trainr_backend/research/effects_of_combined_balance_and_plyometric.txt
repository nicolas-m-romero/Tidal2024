ABSTRACT
Bouteraa, I, Negra, Y, Shephard, RJ, and Chelly, MS. Effects of
combined balance and plyometric training on athletic performance in female basketball players. J Strength Cond Res
34(7): 1967–1973, 2020—The purpose of this study was to
examine the effect of 8 weeks combined balance and plyometric training on the physical fitness of female adolescent basketball players. Twenty-six healthy regional-level players were
randomly assigned to either an experimental group (E; n =
16, age = 16.4 6 0.5) or a control group (C; n = 10, age =
16.5 6 0.5). C maintained their normal basketball training
schedule, whereas for 8 weeks E replaced a part of their standard regimen by biweekly combined training sessions. Testing
before and after training included the squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), drop jump (DJ), 5-, 10-, and 20-m
sprints, Stork balance test (SBT), Y-balance test (YBT) and
modified Illinois change of direction test (MICODT). Results
indicated no significant intergroup differences in SJ and CMJ
height; however, E increased their DJ height (p , 0.05, Cohens’d = 0.11). No significant intergroup differences were
found for sprint performance or SBT, but dynamic YBT tended
to a significant group interaction (p = 0.087, d = 0.006). Post
hoc analysis also showed a significant increase of MICODT for
E (D 6.68%, p = 0.041, d = 0.084). In summary, the addition of
8 weeks of balance and plyometric training to regular in-season
basketball training proved a safe and feasible intervention that
enhanced DJ height, balance, and agility for female adolescent
basketball players relative to the standard basketball training
regimen.

INTRODUCTION

B

asketball is characterized by activities that range
from low-intensity running and walking to maximal sprints and jumps. Some short sprints include
rapid changes of direction and velocity, and agility is thus an important component of the skills required for
this sport (13).
Previous authors have recommended both plyometric
(21) and balance training (4,18) to improve muscular
strength and power, and to decrease the incidence and
severity of sport-related injuries (14). Plyometrics is
a dynamic form of resistance training with a rapid stretchshortening cycle, involving both vertical and horizontal
displacements of the individual’s center of gravity (23). Component exercises include jumping, hopping, and skipping,
with multijoint actions, rapid eccentric phases, and highvelocity concentric muscular contractions potentiated by
the stretch reflex (2,18,21). Such training is well suited to
enhancing vertical jump height and running speed (10),
rebound jump height (25), agility (18,21), and balance (18).
Balance can be defined as the ability to maintain the
body’s center of gravity over its base of support; it reflects
appropriate neuromuscular actions in response to continuous visual, vestibular, and somato-sensory cues (5). A
good balance is a prerequisite of success in almost every
sport (3,4,9); it also enhances athletic performance (17,22)
and has value in the prevention of athletic injuries. Basketball players must address issues of physical contact and
other situations challenging their balance, such as twisting
movements (particularly of the pivot foot) during jump
shots, offensive and defensive rebounds, accelerations
and decelerations with changes of direction, penetrations
into the defensive perimeter, boxing-out, and dribbling
(5). These various actions are all performed in a limited
space and require very fast movements, a high coordinating ability and appropriate strength (5). Because balance
and coordination are not fully developed in children of
either sex (28), it is important that specific balance training be incorporated into programs for adolescents (3). A

Combined Training in Female Basketball Players

number of studies have shown improved balance-related
test scores with balance training (16,17,22). Gandevia (15)
further indicated that balance training could improve proprioceptive feedback, resulting in a more rapid and greater
neuromuscular activation during plyometric exercise. Balance training may prepare for subsequent plyometric
training by improving the mechanics of landing and takeoff (20). Moreover, balance training may precondition
a player for a subsequent resistance regimen (8).
Several authors have recently offered combined plyometric and balance training to young athletes (9,16,27).
Zemkova and Hamar (33) showed that 6 weeks of combined agility and balance training significantly enhanced
dynamic balance, running speed, agility, and the ground
contact time during a drop jump (DJ) relative to a group
that received only agility training. An 8-week combined
program of balance and plyometric exercises also proved
superior to plyometrics alone in terms of improving sprint
and shuttle-run performance (9). However, to our knowledge, there have been no prior studies of combined balance and plyometric in female adolescent basketball
players.
This study thus aimed to examine the effects of replacing
a part of the standard basketball training regimen by 8 weeks
of combined balance + plyometric training in female adolescent basketball players. The initial hypothesis was that the
experimental group would show greater gains of physical
fitness than a control group who followed the standard basketball training regimen.

METHODS
Experimental Approach to the Problem

We examined whether 8 weeks of biweekly in-season
combined balance and plyometric training would enhance
selected aspects of performance in female U17 basketball
players relative to their peers who continued to follow the
standard in-season regimen. A group of 26 regional-level
players (see Procedures and Evaluation for details of
training) volunteered for random assignment to either an
experimental group (E; n = 16) or a control group that
continued to follow the standard in-season regimen (C; n
= 10). Both groups had been training for 3 months and
were already 1 month into the competitive season. Data
were collected before the modification of training and
after completion of the 8-week trial. The test protocol
included assessments of jumping ability (squat jump [SJ],
countermovement jump [CMJ], DJ), linear speed (5, 10,
and 20-m sprints), change of direction test (modified Illinois change of direction test [MICODT]), and measures
of balance (standing Stork balance test [SBT] and Y-balance test [YBT]). Initial and final testing was conducted at
the same time of day (7:30–9:30 AM), and under the same
experimental conditions, at least 48 hours after the last
training session or match.

Subjects

Anthropometric data for E and C are presented in Table 1.
Players who missed more than 20% of training sessions and/
or more than 2 consecutive sessions were excluded from the
study (26). All subjects were free of injuries during the 6
months before and throughout the study.
All procedures were in accordance with the latest
version of the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved
by the ISSEP – Ksar Said’s Review Committee for the
ethical use of human subjects according to current
national laws and regulations and procedures. All participants and their legal representatives were first informed
about testing and training procedures, and possible benefits and risks related to the study. Written informed consent from the children and their legal representatives was
then obtained.
Procedures

Squat Jump, Countermovement Jump, and Drop Jump. The
heights of the SJ, CMJ, and DJ were determined using the
Optojump photoelectric system (Microgate SRL, Bolzano,
Italy). Subjects began the SJ at a knee angle of 908, avoiding
any downward movement, and performed a vertical jump by
pushing upwards, keeping their legs straight throughout.
The CMJ began from an upright position, with the subject
making a rapid downward movement to a knee angle of
;908 and simultaneously beginning to push-off. During the
DJ, subjects were asked to rebound from a 0.3-m height box,
immediately making a vertical jump. During all 3 jumps,
subjects kept their hands on their hips and jumped as high
as possible. One minute of rest was allowed between trials,
with the highest jump on each test being used in subsequent
analyses. The Optojump photoelectric cells consist of 2 parallel bars (a transmitter and a receiver unit), placed approximately 1 m apart. The transmitter contains 32 light-emitting
diodes, positioned at 31-mm intervals, 3 mm above ground
level. Proprietary software (Optojump version 3.01.0001)
connected to a personal computer allowed quantification
of jump heights. The flight time of vertical jumps was

Running Speed. Performance over a 20-m sprint was assessed
at 5, 10, and 20-m using an electronic timing system with 4
single beam photoelectric gates (Microgate, Bolzano). Subjects made a standing start 0.3-m before the first gate, which
was placed 0.75-m above the ground to ensure it captured
trunk movement and avoided false signals from limb motion.
Three trials were separated by 6–8 minutes recovery intervals. The ICCs were 0.92, 0.94, and 0.97 over distances of 5,
10, and 20-m, respectively.

Stork Static Balance Test. The
Stork test was performed on
the dominant leg (27). Subjects
stood with their opposite foot
resting against the inside of the
supporting knee and both
hands on the hips. On the
“go” signal, they raised the heel
of their foot from the floor.
The posture was held as long
as possible, but the test was terminated when the heel of the
supporting leg touched the
ground or the foot moved
away from the knee cap. The
ICC was 0.90.

Y-Balance Test. Dynamic balance was assessed for the dominant leg using the lower
quarter YBT (27). Barefoot
subjects maintain a single leg
stance while reaching as far as
possible with the contralateral
leg in 3 directions (anterior,
postero-medial, and posterolateral) set by fixing tape measures to the floor. The 2
posterior lines extended at an
angle of 1358 from the anterior
line. Athletes’ leg lengths were first determined while lying
supine, measuring from the anterior superior iliac spine to
the most distal aspect of the medial malleolus. They then
stood with the tip of their great toe at the center of the grid.
They were asked to reach in the 3 directions while maintaining a single-limb stance. Trials were repeated if the participant (a) did not touch the required line with the reaching
foot while maintaining weight bearing on the stance leg, (b)
lifted the stance foot from the center of the grid, (c) lost
balance at any point, (d) did not maintain start and return
positions for one full second, or (e) touched the reaching
foot to gain support. The maximal reach was measured in
each direction. The composite score (CS) was calculated as:
CS = ([maximum anterior reach distance + maximum
postero-medial reach distance + maximum postero-lateral
reach distance]/[leg length 3 3] 3 100) (27). Three test
trials were conducted in each direction, with 2-minute rest
intervals. Test–retest reliability for the different reach directions ranged between 0.90 and 0.95.
Modified Illinois Change of Direction Test. This test was
administered as outlined by Hachana et al. (19). Four
markers defined a 5 m2 area. Three central markers were
placed 2.5 m apart. Participants started from a prone position, with the chin touching the starting line. They

RESULTS

accelerated for 5-m, turned around, ran back to the starting
line, and swerved in and out of 3 markers, completing 5-m
sprints to finish the MICODT course. They were instructed
to run around and not to cut over the markers; if they failed
to follow these instructions, the trial was restarted after a 3minute recovery period. The ICC was 0.94.
Details of Training Program. All subjects avoided any training
other than that associated with the basketball team throughout the study. Every Tuesday and Thursday for 8 weeks,
experimental subjects replaced a part of their regular training
routine with the combined training program. A standardized
8–15-minute warm-up was completed before every training
session; this included low intensity running, coordination
exercises, dynamic movements (lunges and skips), sprints,
and dynamic stretching of the lower-limb muscles (26,27).
Combined training drills lasted around 45 minutes (30 minutes for balance exercises; 15 minutes for plyometric). Sessions comprised 3 balance exercises, followed by 3
plyometric exercises. The number of repetitions, sets, and
the complexity of the exercises were increased progressively
over the 8 weeks to limit stress musculotendinous stress
(Tables 2 and 3). Balance training was based on previous
recommendations for intensity and volume (5). In the plyometric program, subjects were instructed to jump as high as
possible in the vertical jumps and as far as possible in the
horizontal drills with a minimal ground contact time. The
total number of ground contacts per week increased progressively from 80 to 120 over the 8 weeks of training.
Respective rest intervals of 90-second and 30-second rest
were allowed between each plyometric and balance exercise
sets (27).
Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS 20 program
for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Normality of all
variables was tested using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov procedure. Means and SDs were calculated, using standard statistical methods. Training related effects were assessed by 2-way
mixed analyses of variance (group 3 time) with repeated measures on time. When group 3 time interactions reached statistical significance, post hoc paired t-tests identified significant
comparisons. Effect sizes (ESs) were determined by converting
partial eta-squared to Cohen’s d. According to Cohen (12), ESs

During the intervention period,
4 control subjects dropped out
of the trial because they left the training center for personal
reasons. Baseline and postintervention values for the remaining experimental and control subjects are summarized in
(Table 4).
Vertical-Jump Tests

There were no significant main effects of time for SJ (p =
0.36, d = 0.018) or CMJ (p = 0.58, d = 0.006), and no significant group x time interactions for SJ (p = 0.19, d = 0.035) or
CMJ (p = 0.14, d = 0.044). However, DJ height showed
a significant main effect of time (p = 0.02, d = 0.09) and
a significant group 3 time interaction (p , 0.05, d = 0.11).
Post hoc analysis showed a significant increase in DJ height
from pretest to posttest only in E (D 15.2%, p , 0.001, d =
2.1), but no significant main effect of time (p = 0.519 and d =
0.19) or group 3 time interaction (p = 0.591 and d = 0.16) in
the measure of DJ power.
Running Speed

No significant effects were found for any sprint interval (p .
0.05; d = 0.068, 0.063, and 0.064 for 5, 10, and 20-m, respectively), and no significant group 3 time interactions (p =
0.87, 0.32, 0.75; d = 0.001, 0.02, and 0.002, for 5, 10, and
20-m, respectively).
Stork Balance Test

A significant effect of time and a significant group 3 time
interaction were observed for the SBT (p = 0.002, d = 0.96; p
= 0.01, d = 0.77). Post hoc analysis revealed a significant
increase in SBT performance in E (D 127.17%, d = 2.10,
and p , 0.001).
Y-Balance Test

The YBT showed a significant main effect of time (p = 0.013,
d = 0.123) and a tendency toward a significant group x time
interaction (p = 0.087, d = 0.06). Post hoc analysis showed
a significant increase of YBT performance in E (D 9.7%, d =
3.92, and p , 0.001).
Change of Direction Tests

A significant main effect of time and a significant group 3
time interaction were established for the MICODT (p =
0.012, d = 0.124; p = 0.041, d = 0.084). Post hoc analysis
showed a significant increase in MICODT performance in E
(D 6.68%, p , 0.001, d = 2.91).

DISCUSSION
This study aimed to examine the effects on the physical
fitness of female adolescent basketball players of replacing
a part of standard basketball training by an 8-week
combined balance + plyometric training. The main findings were of greater improvements in E than in C with
respect to DJ, balance, and MICODT performance. However, the combined program did not achieve significantly
greater gains in SJ, CMJ, or running speed.
There were no significant improvements in measures
of SJ and CMJ. These results are in line with Zemkova
and Hamar (33), who found no significant improvements
in SJ or CMJ after 6 weeks of combined agility and balance training in male basketball players (age = 20.9 6 2.4
years). However, Latorre Roman et al. (24) observed a significant improvement in jumping ability (CMJ: [D 1.4%,
d = 1.3]; SJ: [D 1.6%, d = 0.6]; DJ20: [D 1.2%, d = 0.88];
DJ40: [D 1.7%, d = 0.68]; and SLJ: [D 5.2%, d = 0.16])
after 10 weeks of contrast training in prepuberal basketball players. Asadi et al. (1) also reported a significant
increase in jumping ability in young basketball players
(vertical jump: [D 14.1%, d = 2.8]; and broad jump: [D
4.8%, d = 2.4]) after 8 weeks of plyometric training. Further, Ramirez-Campillo et al. (29) showed a significant
improvement in jumping ability (CMJ: [D 4.4%, ES =
0.23]; SJ: [D 5.1%, ES = 0.27]) after 6 weeks of plyometric
training in female soccer players. These divergent results
may reflect differences in the initial fitness level of study
participants. Another factor may be the high number of
jumps made during training sessions, relative to the requirements of the sport; during a basketball game, the
percentage of jumps with the ball is 44.1 6 5.9% and
15.8 6 1.3% without the ball (13); this limits the potential
for any significant improvement in E relative to C. Nevertheless, the present study showed a significant improvement in DJ height and power (p = 0.016; p = 0.006,
respectively), extending the previous findings of Chelly
et al. (11) who had observed a significant enhancement
in DJ height and power in addition to significant changes
in SJ and CMJ performance of young male track athletes
after 10 weeks of plyometric training. Zemkova and Hamar (33) also showed a reduction of ground contact time
during the DJ (p # 0.05; from 0.294 6 0.051 seconds to
0.261 6 0.047 seconds), and an improvement in the ability to differentiate the force of muscle contraction during
repeated jumps after a training program for basketball
players.
The present findings indicated no change in sprint
times after 8 weeks of combined balance and plyometric
training. This is in accordance with Thomas et al. (32),
who saw no significant improvements of running speed in
postadolescent semiprofessional soccer players (aged =
17.3 6 0.4 years) after 6 weeks of either depth-jump or
CMJ training. Likewise, Hammami et al. (20) observed no

Combined Training in Female Basketball Players

significant improvements in the running speed of junior male
soccer players (aged = 15.7 6 0.2 years) after 8 weeks of
plyometric training. In contrast, a recent study (24) saw
a small but significant improvement in 25-m sprint times
of prepubertal basketball players (mean age, 8.7 6 0.9 years)
after 10 weeks of contrast training (D 0.3%, d = 0.86). Likewise, previous investigation (9) reported a significant
improvement in 10-m sprint times of 12–15 years male adolescents (10 m: D 5%, d = 20.86; 30 m: D 2.8%, d = 20.55)
after 8 weeks of a combined balance and plyometric training
program. Asadi et al. (1) also showed a significant improvement in 60-m sprint performance of male basketball players
after 8 weeks of plyometric training (D 16%, d = 21.6).
These discrepant findings probably reflect differences in
methodology (male vs. female athletes, adolescent vs. much
younger players; elite or professional players vs. regional
level players; the format of the plyometric exercises, the
frequency, duration, and progression of training; and its timing relative to the playing season). The optimal approach to
enhancing sprint performance seems to incorporate greater
horizontal acceleration (skipping, jumping with horizontal
displacement) (31). An enhanced sprint performance is most
likely caused by increases in neuromuscular activation of the
trained muscles, including increases in the firing frequencies
of active motor units and changes in their recruitment patterns (30).
Balance training studies have documented enhanced
athletic performance (4,17,22), contributing to the prevention of athletic injuries and postural stabilization (6). The
present findings showed a significant improvement (p ,
0.001, d = 2.1) in static balance after 8 weeks of the combined training. Boccolini et al. (5) also found a significant
increase in the sustained bi-podalic and mono-podalic positions (p , 0.01) of young male basketball players after 12
weeks of balance training. Likewise, Negra et al. (27) detected a significant improvement in performance of the stable stork (D 121%, p , 0.01, d = 1.3) and the unstable SBTs
(D 149%, p , 0.01, d = 1.83) of prepubertal male soccer
players after 8 weeks of unstable plyometric training. Others
(9) reported a large increase in the Stork balance performance of adolescent male children (age = 13.3 6 0.8 years)
after 8 weeks of combined plyometric + balance training (D
87.8%, d = 1.62). The same study detected a smaller increase
(D 59.6%, d = 0.72) in the Stork balance score after 8 weeks
of plyometric training.
The present investigation showed a tendency toward
significant interaction effects for the dynamic YBT (p =
0.087, d = 0.06). In accord with the concept of training
specificity (4), one would expect that a program that
included balance activities would enhance balance scores
relative to a program without such exercises. Others have
shown enhanced dynamic balance, Zemkova and Hamar
et al. (33) after agility-balance training, and Granacher
et al. (18) a significant main effect of time for the star excursion balance score in subelite soccer players after 8 weeks of

1972

the

plyometric training on stable and unstable surfaces (D 2.8%,
p , 0.050, 0.46 # F # 1.36). Likewise, Negra et al. (27)
observed improvements in the dynamic balance of prepubertal male soccer players (stable Y-balance test: p . 0.05,
d = 0.39, unstable Y-balance test: p . 0.05, d = 0.08), after
plyometric training conducted on stable and unstable surfaces, and Granacher et al. (18) and Johnson et al. (21) both
underlined that plyometric training can be safe and effective
for youth.
The current study demonstrated a significant reduction of
MICODT time after 8 weeks of the combined training
program. This is consistent with Latorre Roman et al. (24)
who noted enhanced change of direction performance in prepubertal male basketball players aged 8.72 6 0.97 years (D
1.6%, d = 0.8) after 10 weeks of biweekly contrast training
(isometric + plyometric) without external load. Likewise, Asadi et al. (1) found gains of agility (T-test [D 8.3%, d = 2.2] and
Illinois change of direction test [D 5.8%, d = 1.4]) after 8 weeks
of plyometric training program in young basketball players.
Further, 8 weeks of combined plyometric + balance training
yielded greater improvements in shuttle run times than plyometric training alone in 12–15 year old male adolescents (D
8%, d = 0.52) (9). Moreover, Ramiez-Campillo et al. (29)
demonstrated increased change of direction speed performance (D 2.8%, ES = 0.46) after 6 week of plyometric training
program in female soccer players, and Zemkova and Hamar
(33) showed a significant speeding of simple reaction time in
an agility test (D = 5.8%) when a combined agility-balance
training program on wobble boards was compared with agility training on a stable surface.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first
to have investigated the effect of combined balance and
plyometric on proxies of physical fitness in female adolescent basketball players. Our findings imply that female
basketball players benefit from an in-season combined
training program. Notably larger performance improvements were found in the experimental group compared with
the control group in terms of SBT, agility, DJ performance,
and the YBT performance.
Nevertheless, some methodological limitations warrant
mention. Firstly, the number of participants was limited (n =
16 for E and n = 10 for C, respectively). Secondly, neuromuscular changes were not quantified, and ground reaction
forces were not measured during jump and sprint performances. Biomechanical and electrophysiological testing methods should be added to future studies to obtain in-depth
knowledge regarding details of the adaptive processes after
combined training.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
The present study shows the feasibility of incorporating
combined balance-plyometric training into a regular basketball training regimen for female U17 basketball players. A
combined training program improves DJ height, dynamic
balance, and agility. On the other hand, such training is

Therefore, the present findings should help coaches and
exercise scientists in their quest to optimize daily training
routines and to enhance the performance of tasks critical to
the success of female adolescent basketball players.
